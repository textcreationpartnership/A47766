            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But the uſe I have to make of it, is to ſhew the Authority which their <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Meetings</hi> do aſſume over the <hi>Light within <hi>Particular Perſons;</hi>
                  </hi> which was the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon which the <hi>Quakers</hi> firſt ſet up, and decry'd all <hi>Church-Authority</hi> as <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Anti-Chriſtian.</hi> That is (as they have done the Power of the <hi>Sword</hi>) till it come into their own Hands.<note place="margin">See <hi>Sect.</hi> II. p. 14.</note>

               <p>This <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi>
                  </hi> may be added to the Proceedings againſt <hi>G.

X.</hi> from <hi>p. 118.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another thing of a more aſtoniſhing Nature. You will ſee <hi>Sect. IX.</hi> of the Antient Pretence of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> in the <hi>ſame Degree</hi> that the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had. And, as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, it is ſhewn <hi>Sect. X.</hi> how they have aſpir'd to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that not only of their <hi>Church</hi> (as they call it) but in each of their <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons.</hi> And <hi>Hence</hi> they have taken upon them to pronounce <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:32815:7"/>and <hi>Curſes</hi> (as all their <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> that I have met with, are) in the ſame Stile with the <hi>Holy Prophets, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord. This is from the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> Several of which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> thus ſolemnly Denounced, have prov'd Errant <hi>Lyes,</hi> as is ſhewn from Remarkable Inſtances.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Now I did really think that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Quakers</hi> were aſham'd of theſe <hi>Groſs Deluſions,</hi> ſo Palpably De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, paſt all Contradiction: Tho' they wou'd not own it, nor <hi>Publicly</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure theſe <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> of theirs, becauſe of overthrowing their <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the pretended <hi>Sanctity</hi> of theſe their <hi>Leaders.</hi> And this was the reaſon that I thought it highly uſeful to lay open their <hi>Horrid Deceit,</hi> for this purpoſe chiefly, That I might, by this
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:32815:8"/>bring our <hi>Preſent Quakers</hi> under that <hi>Happy Neceſſity,</hi> as I thought, of Diſowning the <hi>Mad Enthuſiaſm</hi> of theſe their Adored <hi>Guides;</hi> and thereby perſuade them to return to the <hi>Sobriety</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> in <hi>Odium</hi> to which, as a <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Spiritleſs</hi> Diſpenſation, they had been Betrayd by theſe <hi>Phariſaical Pretenders,</hi> to quit the Communion of a <hi>Regularly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Church. But <hi>(Alas!)</hi> the Iſſue has quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Expectations; for our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Obſtinate</hi> Quakers</hi> not only refuſe to be brought to diſown their own <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> (though they cannot deny the Inſtances wherein they are prov'd to be ſuch) but do ſtill <hi>Fearleſly</hi> go on, and pretend themſelves to the ſame <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of <hi>Immediate Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
                  <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:32815:8"/>and, thereby a Right to affix <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Seal, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
                  </hi> to whatever their <hi>Rage,</hi> their <hi>Malice,</hi> or their <hi>Folly</hi> ſhall ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>If they think theſe too hard words, they ſhall have harder yet: For this matter cannot be compounded. No! This is nothing ſhort of <hi>Blaſphemy; <hi>Rank, wild</hi> Blaſphemy!</hi> And the Honour of <hi>God</hi> muſt take place of any Reſpect to Men (and I have a great deal for ſome, who are too much herein concern'd) therefore I must, I cannot help it, yea <hi>Wo to me if I do it not,</hi> I muſt freely and openly Rebuke this <hi>Proud <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Spirit,</hi> which <hi>Seduces</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and ſpeaks to them <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> whereby they are brought to Worſhip <hi>It</hi>— What is <hi>That?</hi> What is <hi>It,</hi> which pretends to be God,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:32815:9"/>and is not? Even <hi>That</hi> which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires Men to think what <hi>It</hi> Dictates, to be the <hi>Immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>God Himſelf;</hi> and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens them to affix to it, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Deluſion;</hi> and this <hi>Prince</hi> they Worſhip (tho' Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly) for <hi>God,</hi> who miſtake his <hi>Inſpirations</hi> for <hi>God</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Now I am to tell the Reader, That the ſame day month after <hi>G. Keith</hi> was Excommunicated, as aboveſaid, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> (one of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>Metropolitans</hi>
                  </hi>) thought not that Condemnation ſufficient; but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd him with his <hi>Prophetical Curſe,</hi> in the following words.</p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:32815:9"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Becauſe thou haſt poured out great Contempt and Reproach upon <hi>My</hi> Servants and People, <hi>I</hi> will aſſuredly pour out and bring great Contempt and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> upon Thee.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſigned, <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and Dated the <hi>17th</hi> of the <hi>4th</hi> Month (that is <hi>June, 1695.</hi>) and was ſent to <hi>G. Keith.</hi> But Copies of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:32815:10"/>ſpoken <hi>from the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> as certainly as ever <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold the Destruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the Seventy years Captivity.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to a Man of much greater Conſideration.</p>
               <p>It is told at the end of <hi>Sect. 10.</hi> from <hi>p. 136.</hi> how the otherwiſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-valuable Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> pronounced a Sentence of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> against <hi>George Keith <hi>In the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </hi> It is true this was not taking upon him the Gift of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> like <hi>G. Whitehead;</hi> but it was delivering his own Judgment as the <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>Infallible <hi>Oracles</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And if <hi>G. Keith</hi> does tell us truth (if not, he is in a Man's Hands, that can, and will ſurely correct him) in the ſecond of his Books above-mentioned, <hi>The true Copy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 14.</hi> Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>
                  <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:32815:10"/>did own before the <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> That <hi>the Glorious Power of God, which he felt; did ſo Tranſport him, that he was carry'd beyond himſelf, and knew not whether he was ſitting, ſtanding, or kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when he Pronounc'd that Sentence. This was like St. <hi>Paul<hi>'s whether in the Body or out of the Body, he cou'd not tell</hi>
                  </hi>— Good God! How great is the force of this Mad Spirit of <hi>Enthuſiaſm!</hi> That a Man of Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Known Senſe and Abilities ſhou'd not be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the violent <hi>Tranſports</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Immediate Inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt!</hi> O that our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the whole <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſhou'd be thus expos'd to <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>Atheiſtical Wits,</hi> when they ſhall compare the <hi>Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>
                  <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:32815:11"/>with theſe of <hi>W. Penn, G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. and turn both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like into Ridicule!</p>
               <p>O that the time were come, when theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhou'd at laſt bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this horid <hi>Scandal</hi> they have given to <hi>Chriſtianity!</hi> at leaſt, that Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> who has a ſtock of Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Excellent Natural Parts (too good to be thus Employ'd) may Reſcue himſelf from that Herd of <hi>Zealots,</hi> ſotiſhly poſſeſs'd even to <hi>Blaſphemy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he is thus far towards it (which, to a Man of his Reaſon, I reckon a great way) that he muſt either make out his own <hi>Inſpirations</hi> to be from <hi>God,</hi> in as <hi>High</hi> a <hi>Degree</hi> as thoſe which were given to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> or otherwiſe that he has no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Inſcribe the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon them, as <hi>They</hi> did.</p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:32815:11"/>
               <p>Nay, he muſt not only Defend his own Works, but he must likewiſe Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all the <hi>Falſe Lying <hi>Prophecies</hi>
                  </hi> hereafter told; or otherwiſe he muſt <hi>Un-herd,</hi> and be no longer of <hi>Them,</hi> who dare Father the <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riums</hi> of their own <hi>Brain</hi> upon the <hi>Holy Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He muſt Anſwer one of their own Party, <hi>John Penniman,</hi> who has Printed the Paper he gave in to their laſt <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> Entituled, <hi>A few words of Moment to be Imparted to this Yearly Meeting</hi> (<hi>at</hi> London, <hi>1695.</hi>) <hi>of the People call'd <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </hi> And indeed they are <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Moment,</hi> and to be duly conſider'd by the <hi>Quakers.</hi> They are grounded upon two Quotations out of <hi>George Fox,</hi> as follows.</p>

                     <hi>Calmneſs</hi> of Mind?—Now when <hi>Terrible Shakings, Breakings,</hi> &amp;c. were, they were but for a <hi>little time,</hi> and ſo were <hi>quickly</hi> gone again, and the <hi>Voice of the Lord was not diſtinctly diſcern'd there,</hi> but theſe were that ſin might be Purged out, and then the cauſe of <hi>Terrible Potions</hi> was taken away; and the <hi>ſtillneſs</hi> being come, that's a <hi>durable</hi> thing, a <hi>ſolid</hi> Condition; and <hi>Here</hi> the Mind is brought into a</hi> Capacity <hi>to diſcern the Voice of the Lord; whereas in the time of the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motions,</hi> the Mind was ſo <hi>Hurry'd,</hi> and <hi>Loſs'd</hi> with the <hi>Rage</hi> of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> ſo that there was not a <hi>clear Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what might be done, or left undone in many things.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:32815:23"/>
               <p>And this he gives as an Anſwer to thoſe <hi>modern <hi>Quakers,</hi>
                  </hi> who were offended that this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> had <hi>Ceaſed</hi> among them, and objected that <hi>becauſe the <hi>mighty motions</hi> of the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> are <hi>Ceaſed,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> are <hi>ſtill, cool</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> therefore that the <hi>ſame Power</hi> is not in <hi>meetings</hi>—and they cry, <hi>where is the Power that was at firſt?</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here is a Compariſon made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the State of the <hi>Quakers</hi> from <hi>1650,</hi> to <hi>1660;</hi> and from thence to this time.</p>
               <p>The first State, was their time of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> they were thoſe <hi>Ten</hi> long years in Purging out their <hi>Sin.</hi> And their <hi>Terrible Potions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> wrought <hi>violent Convulſions</hi> in their <hi>Bodies,</hi> of <hi>Tremblings</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,</hi> to the Admiration of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders!</p>
               <pb n="xl" facs="tcp:32815:24"/>
               <p>But there was worſe than that. For, as <hi>Livingſton</hi> here Informs us, during theſe <hi>Extatick</hi> years, they were not in a <hi>Solid</hi> Condition, and <hi>the Voice of the Lord was not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned among them,</hi> their <hi>Mind</hi> was ſo <hi>Hurry'd</hi> and <hi>Loſs'd, <hi>ſo that there was not a</hi>
                  </hi> Clear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning <hi>what might be done, or left undone in many things.</hi> This is a very ſad Beckoning! For what now will become of the <hi>Firſt <hi>Quaker In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
                  </hi> ſet up in theſe ſame <hi>Ten <hi>Quaking Purging</hi>
                  </hi> years, <hi>to Diſcern between Truth and Error, between every Falſe and Right way, and which <hi>Perfectly</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to them the true State of <hi>All things?</hi>
                  </hi> And that not only to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> or ſome of the <hi>Chief</hi> of them, but to <hi>every one of them in Particular,</hi> as you will ſee hereafter, <hi>Sect. X. p. 72, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="xli" facs="tcp:32815:24"/>
               <p>It ſeems that theſe <hi>Hurryings</hi> and <hi>Toſſing,</hi> for the firſt <hi>Ten</hi> years, did not come from the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe, <hi>Livingſton</hi> ſays that they <hi>Hindred</hi> the <hi>Diſcerning</hi> the <hi>Voice of the Lord.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Extaſies</hi> of the Holy <hi>Prophets</hi> did moſt perfectly diſcover to them the <hi>Voice of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>what was to be done, or left undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Livingſton</hi> ſays plainly, that they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) were <hi>Hurry'd</hi> and <hi>Toſs'd</hi> thus by the <hi>Rage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> That is, of the <hi>Devil.</hi> And that it was this which hindred them from the <hi>Clear Diſcerning of what might be done or left undone in many things.</hi> For ſurely, no <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from <hi>God</hi> cou'd Hinder this. And I hope no <hi>Quaker <hi>Now</hi>
                  </hi> will ſay that the <hi>Extraordinary Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
                  <pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:32815:25"/>of the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> of Old, were caus'd by the <hi>Rage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> when the <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell us plainly, that they were cauſed by the Extraordinary Impulſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Thoſe cauſed by the <hi>Rage of the Enemy,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to themſelves. And as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonstration of it, it is apparent that ſince their Extraordinary <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> Fits have ceaſed, they have (many of them) return'd to a more <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mind.</hi> And the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of them now ſeek to <hi>Cover</hi> and <hi>Palliate,</hi> all that they can, the <hi>Madneſs</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance</hi> of their firſt <hi>Quaking State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they will not yet Condemn it. Nay, ſometimes (for they are all made up of Contradictions) they will ſupport it, and plead for it. And that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:32815:25"/>as an <hi>Extraordinary Inſpiration</hi> for ſome time; but as an <hi>Holy Duty.</hi> And if it be ſuch, it muſt bind for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Sam. Fiſher,</hi> in his <hi>Ruſticus ad Academicos.</hi> Exercit. <hi>2. p. 18.</hi> ſays, <hi>As for that <hi>Holy Duty</hi>
                  </hi> it ſelf of <hi>Quaking, <hi>which as Blind a Guide, and Brute a Beaſt as Thou</hi>
                  </hi> (thus he treats Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in the <hi>Quaker <hi>Courtly</hi>
                  </hi> Dialect) <hi>art in ſpeaking evil of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now if it be an <hi>Holy Duty,</hi> then are the <hi>Preſent Quakers</hi> fallen from their <hi>Duty,</hi> and from their <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it is an Effect of the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> then have not the <hi>Preſent Quakers</hi> ſuch a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as the <hi>Firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> had, which I ſuppoſe they will not be willing to own. For then there will
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:32815:26"/>be <hi>Degrees</hi> in their <hi>Infallibility:</hi> And if it be once coming <hi>Down Stairs</hi>—</p>
               <p>But if (as in truth it is) that their <hi>Quaking</hi> and <hi>Shaking</hi> proceeded from a ſtrong Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> it will follow, that all was a <hi>Deluſion</hi> then; and muſt be ſo ſtill, while our <hi>Modern Quakers</hi> take upon them to Juſtifie thoſe who went before them, and their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And, by <hi>G.

                  </hi> and their <hi>Quaking</hi> was the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> now are <hi>Inſpir'd</hi> by <hi>Him,</hi> and are <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Diviners,</hi> and <hi>Conjurers.</hi> And this, as <hi>G.

               <p>I have briefly ſhewn what ſort of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration</hi> is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd</hi> and <hi>own'd</hi> in our <hi>Church:</hi>
                  <pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:32815:32"/>And it is full as much as any <hi>ſober Quaker</hi> can mean by the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Which therefore, in this Sence, is not <hi>Diſowned</hi> but <hi>Avowed</hi> by us. And as much ſtreſs is laid upon it, as they can reaſonably deſire. It is made <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to every <hi>Good Work</hi> and <hi>Thought:</hi> And the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all the <hi>Good</hi> that is in us. And we are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to it, to <hi>Follow</hi> and be <hi>Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by it; and are aſſur'd that it will lead us to all <hi>Truth</hi> that is requiſite and neceſſary for our Eternal Salvation.

               <p>If any <hi>Quaker</hi> (as I am confident all that are in the least ſober-minded
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:32815:32"/>will) ſay that this is all they mean by their <hi>Light within;</hi> then where is the Difference? Why do they break off, and ſeparate from our Communion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pretence of the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> wherein we agree with them? What Reaſon have they to Cenſure ours, and all other <hi>Miniſteries</hi> but their own? as Mr <hi>Penn</hi> ſays, in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal, p. 38. We have ſeen</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Fruit of <hi>All other Miniſtries</hi> by the few that are turned from the Evil of their Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, This is a very bad Argument: for Mens being Evil, may proceed from their own Preverſeneſs, and not from the Fault of the <hi>Miniſtery.</hi> We find but about <hi>120</hi> that were Converted by the Miniſtery of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all his Life-time. <hi>Acts 1.15.</hi>

               <p>And, by Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Conſequence, this muſt be charg'd upon the <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and as a Proof that it was not Good: And to justifie rather the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of <hi>Thendas, Acts 5.36, 37.</hi> who got about <hi>400</hi> to follow him; and <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> drew away <hi>Much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Secondly, This is a most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Preſumption, and the Heigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> to Condemn All the World but themſelves. While they cannot deny that there are many in other Communions of <hi>Sober, Honeſt,</hi> and, to all appearance, <hi>Religious</hi> Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that is no matter!

               <p>Therefore, to obviate all theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and to prevent the deceiving of after-Generations, who may not be
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:32815:39"/>ſo well able to Examine into matters of Fact, ſaid to be done long before their time, it is deſir'd that Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> wou'd <hi>Now</hi> Publiſh his <hi>Regiſter</hi> of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Prophecies,</hi> or for ever after hold his Peace.</p>
               <p>But we muſt take them as he pleaſes to give them; and by what he has told us, we may gueſs at the reſt. He names <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Fire <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>in expreſs Terms.</hi>
                  </hi> And there he leaves us in the General, but tells not, <hi>who, where, when;</hi> that is reſerv'd for after Ages, when there ſhall be none alive to diſprove it.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding it is fair in us, freely to own what is come to our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, tho' the Modeſty of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd, might let it ſleep in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals</hi> unexamin'd.</p>

                  <hi>Be it known then unto all Men,</hi> That one <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> a <hi>Quaker <hi>Preacher</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> did go <hi>Naked</hi> through <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> the year before the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with a Pan of Fire upon his Head, warning the People to Repent. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it muſt likewiſe be known, that there is not a <hi>Year,</hi> hardly a <hi>Month</hi> wherein ſome <hi>Quaker</hi> or other is not going about our ſtreets here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> either <hi>Naked,</hi> or in ſome <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Figure, Denouncing <hi>Woes, Iudgments, Plagues, Fire, Sword,</hi> and <hi>Famine. <hi>[And it was never more likely that ſome, or all of theſe may be coming towards us]</hi>
                  </hi> nay ſo frequent are theſe <hi>Quaker-Prophets</hi> amongſt us, eſpecially in <hi>Curſes</hi> (wherein they wholly Deal) that there is not a <hi>Bill of

               <p>But if the <hi>Quaker Prophets</hi> knew ſo particularly of the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> how came it to paſs, that they were not better provided againſt it? For it is well known that the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> did ſuffer as much, by the <hi>Fire,</hi> as any of their Neighbours, and were as much <hi>Surpris'd</hi> by it. As themſelves have confeſs'd.</p>

               <p>If it be not ſo, Why then do you not <hi>now</hi> pay your <hi>Tythes</hi> to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> Why do you boaſt of your <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> for not paying your Tythes to <hi>them,</hi> as being a ſort of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> for the truth?</p>

               <p>Why will you not allow them what you your ſelves ſo much plead for, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience,</hi> in this Caſe?</p>
               <pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:32815:67"/>
               <p>No, This is a Material Cauſe, This is the ſureſt Method to Deſtroy the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And you have gone a great way in it already.</p>
               <p>For if they are Depriv'd, first, of the <hi>Tythes</hi> of all the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (who are not ſo few, by the loweſt Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as <hi>one hundred thouſand</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>) and then of all thoſe who, to avoid Payment of their <hi>Tythes,</hi> will pretend to be perſuaded by them herein; if the <hi>Tythes</hi> of all ſuch were ſubſtracted, there wou'd not be ſufficient left to keep half the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from Starving.</p>
               <p>And it is the <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to <hi>Starve</hi> them, as is plainly <hi>Confeſs'd</hi> and <hi>Threaten'd</hi> or <hi>Propheſy'd</hi> of in <hi>Richard Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn's</hi> Works Re-printed ſince <hi>1660.</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>John Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, p. 130.</hi>

               <pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:32815:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Law of the Land</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ceaſeth to maintain them</hi> (the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as he calls them) <hi>which will come ſooner than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, then may they begg their Bread, or Periſh for want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this the <hi>Quakers</hi> hope to effect by their Teſtimony againſt <hi>Tythes;</hi> and <hi>Threaten</hi> or <hi>Propheſie,</hi> that it will come <hi>ſooner than we expect,</hi> either to have the <hi>Laws</hi> for <hi>Tythes <hi>alter'd,</hi>
                  </hi> or <hi>overthrown:</hi> if the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> will not <hi>alter</hi> them, they will <hi>overthrow</hi> them, by Declaring them <hi>Anti-Chriſtian,</hi> and ſo <hi>Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> of Courſe.</p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerv'd that there is no <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Quaker Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> wherein they are ſo <hi>Zealous</hi> as in this. They did not think it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Print</hi> againſt
<pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:32815:68"/>
                  <hi>Tythes,</hi> but they went about and got <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> of many <hi>thouſands</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> throughout all <hi>England,</hi> againſt <hi>Tythes;</hi> and ſent them up to the <hi>Parliament</hi> in an <hi>Humble <hi>Threatning</hi>

               <p>I cou'd enlarge, upon this Head, out of the Quaker-Writings:</p>
               <p>But what Authorities I have already produc'd, are abundantly ſufficient to ſhew their deep deſign against the <hi>Church;</hi> and the means by which they have agreed to Deſtroy Her; this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

               <p>Therefore this Handle muſt, by no means, be let go.

               <p>
                  <hi>Seconly,</hi> He bars the <hi>Clergy</hi> from <hi>Suing,</hi> or <hi>uſing</hi> any <hi>Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory means,</hi> to recover their <hi>Tythes,</hi> even from thoſe of their own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

               <p>Yet all this was not ſufficient for the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But <hi>Tho.

                  </hi> as to the matter of <hi>Tythes.</hi> I will conceal none of their Strength.

That their Teſtimony againſt Tythes does</hi> Rather <hi>affect a Popiſh Clergy, than a Proteſtant Civil Government.</hi> The Charm lies in the word <hi>Rather;</hi> and if they are preſs'd <hi>Hereafter</hi> with this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of theirs, as Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tythes:</hi> No, they will ſay, We did not, by that, at all Allow of
<pb n="clxvii" facs="tcp:32815:87"/>
                  <hi>Tythes;</hi> but only, by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, we wou'd <hi>Rather</hi> grant it to a <hi>Proteſtant Civil Government,</hi> than to a <hi>Popiſh Clergy:</hi> Not that we think it lawful to pay them to <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And this is their True and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine meaning by this <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> which I will ſhew yet more fully from the Proofs they bring for it. They bring Precedents, as Vouchers for them, out of <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> of ſome who refus'd <hi>Tythes</hi> to the then <hi>Popiſh Clergy;</hi> and thence wou'd inſinuate as if their Caſe were the ſame. Therefore they grievouſly Accuſe <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> in that <hi>he moſt ſhamefully Quarrels with the</hi> Quakers, <hi>p. 3. for renewing and aſſerting his</hi> (Wickliff's) <hi>and other Famous Proteſtants and Martyrs Teſtimonies againſt the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="clxviii" facs="tcp:32815:88"/>of Prieſts, and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Oppreſſion of Tythes.</hi> And they inſtance another, one <hi>William Thorp,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Hen. IV.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, to ſecure their Double Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Arguments which they Quote of theſe Men, are not againſt Paying of <hi>Tythes</hi> to the then <hi>Prieſts,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>Popiſh,</hi> but as making <hi>Tythes</hi> not proper under the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> which reaches to all <hi>Prieſts,</hi> whether <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> But will the <hi>Quakers</hi> be ty'd to the Opinion of theſe Men, in other things? No, ſurely. They will not ſo much as Pretend to that. Why then ſhou'd they think to tye us to their Opinion as to <hi>Tythes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They lay particular ſtreſs upon the <hi>Ample Teſtimony</hi> (as they call it) <hi>given by <hi>William Thorp,</hi> as to their preſent Purpoſe.</hi> And
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:32815:88"/>they ſet it down at large. It militates againſt <hi>Tythes</hi> being Paid at all under the <hi>New Law,</hi> that is, to any ſort of Prieſts. And how does this ſerve to the <hi>Preſent Purpoſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who wou'd put upon us, that they are only against <hi>Tythes</hi> being Paid to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts: For otherwiſe they do, in no ſort, clear themſelves from <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s Impeachment; which is, their oppoſimg the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, and Preaching them down as <hi>Anti-Chriſtian,</hi> and not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd.</p>
               <p>But as to <hi>Thorp</hi>'s Argument, wherein they ſo much Glory; it ſhews what a <hi>Doughty Clerk</hi> he was. <hi>Our Prieſts</hi> (ſays he) <hi>came not of the Lineage of</hi> Levi, <hi>but of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of</hi> Judah, <hi>to which</hi> Judah <hi>no</hi> Tythes <hi>were Promiſed to be

               <p>But our <hi>Quakers</hi> exceed all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption even in this.

               <p>They ſimper with half a Mouth, and ſay, they mean it not against a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Civil Government;</hi> when, no longer ſince than in their <hi>Yearly Epiſtle</hi> for the Year <hi>1693.</hi> directed from the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to the <hi>Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings</hi> in <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Elſewhere,</hi> it is poſitively En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, <hi>That none ſhou'd Pay</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But we need no <hi>new</hi> Command for them in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> If they are not <hi>Forbidden,</hi> and <hi>Abrogated</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are ſtill of force.

               <p>But there is another <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in <hi>p. 2.</hi> of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Bugg,</hi> viz. That theſe their <hi>Orders</hi> are not <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> but <hi>Epiſtles, wherein ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral matters of Chriſtian</hi> Advice <hi>are <hi>Recommended,</hi> and not <hi>Impoſed:</hi>
                  </hi> This wou'd ſeem as if theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> were left to their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> whether they wou'd pay <hi>Tythes</hi> or not. But the contrary is made ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, in the Inſtances of <hi>Criſp, Story, Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. as before.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Stile</hi> of their <hi>Orders</hi> being call'd <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> I ſuppoſe, they have heard of the Pope's <hi>Decretal Epiſtles.</hi> And he Commands moſt Abſolutely, when he writes himſelf, <hi>Servant of the Servants of God.</hi> Soft <hi>Words,</hi> and Hard <hi>Meaning!</hi> That <hi>Severe</hi> and <hi>Terrible <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>

                  <pb n="clxxxii" facs="tcp:32815:95"/>againſt <hi>John Story,</hi> &amp;c. above told, was by way of <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> which is taken notice of in the above-Quoted <hi>Replication,</hi> in the very Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it, <hi>viz. A Teſtimony againſt the 66 Judges called</hi> Quakers, <hi>who writ an</hi> Epiſtle <hi>(as they call it) againſt</hi> John Story, John Wilkinſon, <hi>and thoſe join'd with them,</hi> &amp;c. I have ſhewn before that not only Their <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> when they are call'd <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> but all, even the very <hi>Queries</hi> of <hi>Theirs</hi> are to be eſteem'd <hi>Equal</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo that (as they ſay) <hi>you might as well condemn the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to the Fire as their <hi>Queries.</hi>
                  </hi> That <hi>Their Writings</hi> are not to be look'd upon as the <hi>Edicts of Men,</hi> but of <hi>God Himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But when they are Pinched, then they are only <hi>Recommendations,</hi>
                  <pb n="clxxxiii" facs="tcp:32815:95"/>and <hi>Advices</hi>— But ſuch as <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>Obey'd,</hi> under the pain of being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Diſown'd</hi> by them. Which, to much the greateſt number of them, conſidering their Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another in Trade, is their utter undoing.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch <hi>Advices</hi> look very like <hi>Commands.</hi> And this laſt Excuſe of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is no better than the former.</p>
               <p>But in all this Anſwer to <hi>Bugg,</hi> they have quite forgot the most material Objection againſt them, which is ſome Quotations of theirs as to <hi>Tythes,</hi> which are cited by <hi>Bugg,</hi> particularly that mention'd <hi>p. 3.</hi> of <hi>Edw. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> in the <hi>780</hi> page of his Works. <hi>Tythes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as received and paid in theſe days</hi>— <hi>are of Anti-Chriſt.</hi> This totally overthrows the
<pb n="clxxxiv" facs="tcp:32815:96"/>
                  <hi>Quakers</hi> Excuſe in their Anſwer to <hi>Bugg,</hi> viz. That they only ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Tythes</hi> being paid to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts, and by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Laws: For here <hi>Edw. Burrough</hi> condemns thoſe <hi>Tythes</hi> as <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> which are <hi>Receiv'd</hi> and <hi>Paid, <hi>in theſe Days;</hi>
                  </hi> which are to <hi>Proteſtant Prieſts,</hi> and by <hi>Proteſtant <hi>Laws.</hi>
                  </hi> And to this the <hi>Quakers Anſwer</hi> has not return'd one word, or taken the leaſt notice of it. No, nor to that other Quotation out of the <hi>Ancient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 2. So it is no new thing that the People of the Lord call'd</hi> Quakers, <hi>have ſuffer'd ſo deeply, for but the Ancient Teſtimony to the Coming, Death, and Reſurrection of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>which they that Plead for</hi> Tythes, <hi>in this Goſpel-Day, do, in effect, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="clxxxv" facs="tcp:32815:96"/>
               <p>Nor to that Quoted out of <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s <hi>Antidote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> which I have mention'd before, but <hi>Bugg</hi> here more at large. Thus, <hi>p. 78.</hi> of the <hi>Antidote; <hi>Truth allows no Payment of</hi>
                  </hi> Tythes <hi>at all under the New Covenant, but Condemns it— They who Pay</hi> Tythes <hi>do therein uphold a Legal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Abrogated by Chriſt; and thereby deny Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh, which is a Mark of Anti-Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the Argument it is Anſwer'd before, That <hi>Tythes</hi> are no <hi>Legal Ceremony;</hi> nor any <hi>Ceremony</hi> at all. They are a <hi>juſt Tribute,</hi> and <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> to God out of that <hi>Encreaſe</hi> with which He has bleſs'd our Labours. This is far above a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> which, in its own Nature,
<pb n="clxxxvi" facs="tcp:32815:97"/>is a thing <hi>Indifferent,</hi> neither <hi>Good,</hi> nor <hi>Bad;</hi> which the Duty of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the Lord with our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is not, but a <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and even a <hi>Natural</hi> Duty: And as to the particular <hi>Quantum</hi> of a <hi>Tenth</hi> part of our <hi>Subſtance,</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd long before the <hi>Law;</hi> and was the Univerſally receiv'd Notion of the <hi>World,</hi> in all <hi>Ages;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> and ſo, far from a <hi>Legal Ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they were no <hi>Ceremony,</hi> ſo neither were they any <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to ceaſe at His Coming, like <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> whoſe firſt Inſtitution was to Prefigure the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſhedding of His <hi>Blood.</hi> And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is call'd by the Name of His <hi>Types; Chriſt our Paſſover is Sacrificed for us, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.7.</hi>
                  <pb n="clxxxvii" facs="tcp:32815:97"/>He is call'd our <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> but he is never call'd our <hi>Tythe.</hi> For that has no Relation to any Typical Repreſentation of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>

               <p>Leonard Fell <hi>Profeſſeth that</hi> Chriſt <hi>had never any</hi> Body <hi>but His</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Richard Huberthorn <hi>wrote that Chriſt coming in the Fleſh, was but a</hi> Figure.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Schedule.</hi> And <hi>G.

               <p>Secondly, To Invite all that are Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Read that <hi>Anſwer</hi> of <hi>Fox<hi>'s Saul</hi>

               <p>And every Reader will judge it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conclude <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> abſolutely Guilty of every part of this Charge, which they refuſe, in this their <hi>Vindication,</hi> thus <hi>Plainly</hi> and <hi>Expreſly</hi> to Diſclaim: Or where they <hi>Dodge,</hi> and <hi>Shift,</hi> and will not give a <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Categorical</hi> Anſwer.

               </p>
               <p>But ſuch is the Caſe of <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Saul's Errand,</hi> above-mentioned; He does not <hi>Plainly</hi> deny, no, not any <hi>one</hi> of the particulars Charg'd upon him, or his Followers, in the <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Schedule,</hi> which he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Nay, he downright owns, and juſtifies the greateſt part of them. As their Preter-natural <hi>Convulſions</hi> and <hi>Quakings, Foamings, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Bellies,</hi> which ſeiz'd them at their <hi>Meetings,</hi> even <hi>little Children,</hi> who cou'd not <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit:</hi>
                  <pb n="ccxi" facs="tcp:32815:109"/>and therefore was, no doubt, plain <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> but whether of a <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Diabolical</hi> Spirit, has been above conſider'd. The matter of Fact <hi>Fox</hi> owns, <hi>p. 5.</hi> and Vindicates it by the <hi>Ecſtaſies</hi> Recorded of the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> of Old. But none of theſe ever ſeiz'd <hi>little Children.</hi> But the <hi>Lapland</hi> Poſſeſſions have, in thoſe who are given up to the Power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> of which there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examples, in our own Countries, beſides theſe of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fox</hi> likewiſe owns the Indictment laid in the <hi>Schedule</hi> againſt <hi>James Milner,</hi> and juſtifies him, tho' he cannot deny the Fact. <hi>As for</hi> James Milner (ſays he <hi>p. 9.</hi>) <hi>tho' his mind did Run out from his Condition, and from minding that Light of God which is in him, whereby
<pb n="ccxii" facs="tcp:32815:110"/>the World takes occaſion to ſpeak againſt the Truth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends ſtumble at it; yet there is a Pure Seed in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Pure Seed</hi> is what the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> mean by <hi>the Light within.</hi> And which they make to be <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and therefore take the Name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>God</hi>'s thus ſuppoſed Dwelling in them.</p>
               <p>But, by this Rule, every Man muſt be <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Equal to God,</hi> as well as a <hi>Quaker,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, that <hi>This Light</hi> is in <hi>every Man that cometh into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But every Man does not follow this <hi>Light.</hi> No more did <hi>James Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or <hi>James Naylor</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And how ſhall we then know
<pb n="ccxiii" facs="tcp:32815:110"/>that <hi>George Fox</hi> did, or any other <hi>Quaker?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is now become of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to a <hi>ſinleſs</hi> Condition, and to <hi>Perfection, <hi>Equal</hi>
                  </hi> even to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>God Himſelf!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Milner</hi> pretended to it. And <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> pretended to it. They <hi>all</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. And they have it <hi>all</hi> alike.</p>
               <p>But how comes <hi>Milner</hi> here to be ſo gently dealt with by Mr. <hi>Fox?</hi> Why! Becauſe his mind did only <hi>Run out.</hi> He did not follow his <hi>Light within.</hi> And do the <hi>Quakers</hi> charge any thing elſe upon the <hi>Heathen,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. but not following their <hi>Light within?</hi> No, nothing elſe.

               <pb n="ccxiv" facs="tcp:32815:111"/>
               <p>Let us then compare a little.

IV. p. 21.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will, in this Compariſon, let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> paſs too, as being further off, and come to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> make to be no leſs than <hi>Anti-Chriſtian,</hi> their <hi>Clergy</hi> to be <hi>Baal's Prieſts, Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="ccxv" facs="tcp:32815:111"/>Conjurers, Diviners,</hi> &amp;c. And why?</p>
               <p>Becauſe they Preach upon a <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> (as in <hi>Artic. 5.</hi> of the above <hi>Schedule</hi>) and in <hi>Steeple-Houſes,</hi> which they call <hi>Churches.</hi> Receive <hi>Tythes,</hi> and have a <hi>ſet Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in their <hi>Publick</hi> Worſhip; and <hi>many ſuch like things do they,</hi> for which they deſerve the above <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets,</hi> and All the rest hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>p. 32.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for <hi>Iames Milner, <hi>there is yet a</hi> Pure Seed <hi>in him.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>the Lord did open true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,</hi>

Robert Porter, <hi>take heed of belying the Innocent, for I hear that thou haſt reported to a Priend of mine, that I ſhou'd ſay, that the Blood of Chriſt is no more than the Blood of another
<pb n="ccxxviii" facs="tcp:32815:118"/>Man. I never ſpake it, but do very highly eſteem of the Blood of Chriſt, to be more Excellent, and Living, and Holy, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than is able to be uttered by the Tongues of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>

                  </gap> think, that he had fully deny'd the Charge againſt him? And that he did highly esteem the Blood of Chriſt? But behold the <hi>Quaker Subtilty!</hi> He does not mean one word of this of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which He ſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Croſs;</hi> but of the <hi>Spiritual Blood</hi> (whatever he, or the <hi>Quakers</hi> intend by it) for after the aboveſaid High Witneſs to the exceeding Value of <hi>Chriſt's Blood,</hi> he adds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the very next words, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf, <hi>I mean</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the
<pb n="ccxxix" facs="tcp:32815:118"/>Blood which was offer'd up in the Eternal Spirit,</hi> Heb. <hi>9.14.</hi> You may ſay, that this was the <hi>outward</hi> Blood, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed upon the <hi>Croſs.</hi> True, it was ſo. For He offer'd his Blood, <hi>through,</hi> or <hi>in</hi> (as this <hi>Quaker</hi> alters the Text, to make it incline the more to their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>the Eternal Spirit.</hi> And if <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> had ſaid no more, ſo it might have paſs'd. But he goes on, in plain words, to tell us what he wou'd be at; and diſtinguiſhes this from the <hi>Blood <hi>outwardly</hi>
                  </hi> ſhed; for having told us what Blood he ſo Highly values, as above, he ſubjoins, in the next words, to ſignifie what <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> it is, which he did not value more than the Blood of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, and that was the <hi>outward <hi>Blood</hi>
                  </hi> which was ſhed upon the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="ccxxx" facs="tcp:32815:119"/>His words are theſe following. <hi>But the Blood that was forced out of Him, by the Souldiers, after He was dead, who before that bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Head to the Father, and gave up the Ghoſt; but thou ſayeſt that was the Blood of the New Covenant which was ſhed after he was dead, which I deny; yet I did ſay, that was no more than the Blood of another Saint. Theſe were my words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he adds a little after, <hi>That the</hi> Baptists <hi>and</hi> Independants, <hi>and</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and the</hi> Pope, <hi>are all of one Ground, and none of you underſtand the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt no more than a Brute Beaſt; therefore Repent, for God will ſuddenly overthrow your Faith, and your Imputative Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="ccxxxi" facs="tcp:32815:119"/>too, for the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which He did at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and without the Gates, the Pope, the Epiſcopal, the Presbyterian, Independants, and Baptiſts, ſhall fare all alike, and ſhall ſit down in ſorrow, ſhort of the Eternal Reſt: But the true Imputative Righteouſneſs of Chriſt we own, but it is Hid from you All, till the Lord open an Eye</hi> within <hi>you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the words of his Letter, which I have tranſcrib'd out a Book wrote by <hi>William Burnet,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Capital Principles of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call'd Quakers,</hi> Printed <hi>1668. p. 41.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here you may ſee how they construe the Imputation of Christ's Righteouſneſs, to be only <hi>within</hi> them:
<pb n="ccxxxii" facs="tcp:32815:120"/>And diſown that which the whole <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World</hi> underſtand by it; and their Notion of Chriſt's <hi>outward</hi> Blood, ſhed <hi>without the Gates</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But they have a Notion of <hi>inward</hi> Blood, <hi>inward</hi> ſhedding, and <hi>inward Imputation,</hi> which no other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> know of, more than <hi>Brute Beaſts, ſays</hi> Eccles. And they expreſly deny Chriſt's <hi>outward</hi> Blood, to be the Blood of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And make no more of it than of the Blood of any other Good Man. See <hi>G. Whitehead's</hi> Impious Defence of this, in <hi>The true Copy,</hi> &amp;c. above Quoted, <hi>p. 24, 25.</hi> To which I will only add, as a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I before obſerv'd, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſeem to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> any thing; but with ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves</hi> as ſecure their own meaning,
<pb n="ccxxxiii" facs="tcp:32815:120"/>and ſerve to Amuſe the Inadvertent Readers. Thus in <hi>G. Whitehead's</hi> Anſwer to this Paſſage of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> in the <hi>58. p.</hi> of his Book En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> Printed <hi>1668.</hi> Repeating the above-quoted words of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>as more Excellent, and Living, and Holy, than is able to be uttered,</hi> &amp;c. he adds, <hi>which might have ſatisfy'd any Spiritual or Unbyaſs'd mind.</hi> And the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> might have gone away with this, as a full Vindication of <hi>Solomon Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> without taking notice how he had, in the ſame place, explain'd himſelf, as I have above Quoted him, not to mean this of Christ's Blood ſhed <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> but only of a Notion which the <hi>Quakers have</hi> of
<pb n="ccxxxiv" facs="tcp:32815:121"/>
                  <hi>Spiritual</hi> Blood, <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſhedding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is all perform'd <hi>within them.</hi> And <hi>G.

Burnet.)</hi> Theſe are his words, <hi>But if</hi> W. B. <hi>intends that the Blood outwardly ſhed by wicked Hands, was the Price and Life of Chriſt, as his words import; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, from his own words, that the Life of Chriſt is not in being; and this wou'd render Him a Dead Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> can ſpeak Honourable things of the Blood of Chriſt <hi>(in his own Senſe)</hi> and this is enough <hi>to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any Unbyaſs'd Mind!</hi> Tho they have evaded the most Expreſs Texts
<pb n="ccxxxv" facs="tcp:32815:121"/>for Chriſt's <hi>Humanity,</hi> even that <hi>Gen. 3.15.</hi> His being <hi>the Seed of the Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They <hi>Allegorize</hi> all that too into a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sence, quite away from the <hi>Letter;</hi> and to mean nothing elſe in the World but their <hi>Light within.</hi> Where they have a <hi>Spiritual <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Spiritual <hi>Seed,</hi>
                  </hi> as well as <hi>Spiritual <hi>Blood.</hi>
                  </hi> Hear how Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> endeavours to prove it, in his part of <hi>The Chriſtian Quaker, p. 97, 98. The Serpent</hi> (ſays be) <hi>is a Spirit: now nothing can bruiſe the Head of the Serpent, but ſomething that is Spiritual, as the Serpent is: But if that Body of Chriſt were the Seed, then cou'd He not bruiſe the Serpents Head in all, becauſe the Body of Chriſt is not ſo much as in any one; and
<pb n="ccxxxvi" facs="tcp:32815:122"/>conſequently, the Seed of the Promiſe is an Holy Principle of Light and Life, that being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Heart, bruiſeth the Serpent's Head: And becauſe the Seed, which cannot be that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is Chriſt, as teſtifie the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Seed is one, and that Seed is Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Thus Mr. <hi>Penn.</hi> And this is his Deduction. That the Seed being <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and he having Prov'd (as he thinks) that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not the <hi>Seed;</hi> his Conſequence is, that the <hi>Promis'd Seed</hi> was not any <hi>Perſon,</hi> but a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> And that this <hi>Principle</hi> is the <hi>Light within,</hi> and conſequently that the <hi>Light within</hi> is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And his <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> ſtands thus in <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> The <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But the <hi>Light within</hi> is the <hi>Seed:
<pb n="ccxxxii" facs="tcp:32815:122"/>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Light within</hi> is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the <hi>Minor</hi> remains yet to be Prov'd, That the <hi>Light within</hi> is the <hi>Promis'd Seed.</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> has only <hi>ſuppoſed:</hi> and that the <hi>Seed</hi> is not a <hi>Perſon,</hi> but a <hi>Principle.</hi> Which is a Suppoſition of ſo Pernicious a Nature, that it <hi>Unchriſtians</hi> any one who holds it. For the Faith of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is built upon that <hi>Man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  </hi> as the <hi>Seed</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to <hi>Bruiſe the Serpent's Head.</hi> And that the <hi>Bruiſing of it,</hi> was Perform'd by the ſhedding of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood <hi>outwardly</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as a <hi>Propitiation</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the Sins of the whole World. Tho' the Application of this to our Souls, muſt by <hi>inwardly</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> not only a bare <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Faith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſo <hi>Suffer, Die, Roſe
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:32815:123"/>again,</hi> &amp;c. which the <hi>Devils</hi> do <hi>Believe,</hi> and <hi>Tremble,</hi> to ſee their Power ſo overcome. But by a <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith</hi> and full abſolute <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> in that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death for our <hi>Sins,</hi> as our <hi>Surety</hi> who has paid our <hi>Debt</hi> for us, and Purchas'd an <hi>Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> for us, upon our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Conditions which He has ſet to us: And not only ſo, but as our <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> now ſitting, in His true <hi>Humane Nature</hi> (whereby He is our <hi>Mediator</hi>) and in the ſame <hi>Body</hi> (tho' <hi>Glorify'd,</hi> and Chang'd in <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> but not in <hi>Subſtance</hi>) at the Right Hand of His Father, to make continual and daily <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us; and to power down His <hi>Spirit</hi> upon us, to give us this <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> for it <hi>is the Gift of God.</hi> And this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
                  <pb n="ccxxxix" facs="tcp:32815:123"/>and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of His <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit,</hi> is the only true Saving <hi>Light within</hi> us; but not the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Himſelf</hi> (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Blaſphemouſly Dream) only a Ray, or Communication of His <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>How then can the <hi>Quakers</hi> have the True <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> how can they be eſteem'd as any <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at all, who will not allow <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Promis'd Seed;</hi> or that He was more a <hi>Man</hi> in the Body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than in the Body of any other Man; who make no more Reckoning of <hi>His Blood,</hi> than of any other Saint; who do not believe Him <hi>now</hi> to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and, as ſuch, our <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor,</hi> at the Right Hand of His Father?

               <p>But I wou'd ask Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> one Queſtion before I go, upon his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of the <hi>Light within</hi> being the <hi>Promis'd Seed.</hi> And that is, ſince the <hi>Quakers</hi> make this <hi>Light within</hi> to be in <hi>every Man that comes into the World,</hi> how was it <hi>Promiſed; <hi>Gen. 3.15?</hi>
                  </hi> Was it not <hi>Then</hi> in the World? And how then were they to look for it as <hi>to come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> has another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>(Ibid.)</hi> to prove that the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Chriſt</hi>

<pb n="ccxli" facs="tcp:32815:124"/>is it the way of Scripture ſo to teach us, the outward Lamb ſhews forth the inward Lamb,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>And by the help of this Diſtinction of an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>Inward <hi>Chriſt,</hi> outward</hi> and <hi>inward <hi>Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> do keep themſelves out of ſight of all Men not throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Deceits.

               <p>But their Groſs Ignorance cou'd not, at <hi>Firſt,</hi> diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Influence:</hi> and thoſe of them who know better <hi>now,</hi> think themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> at leaſt to <hi>Palliate</hi> and <hi>Excuſe</hi> the Failings of their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> becauſe they <hi>once</hi> own'd them to be <hi>Infallible.</hi>

               <p>By this means, all the <hi>Non-ſence</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of <hi>G. Fox</hi> lies upon Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Shoulders.

                  <hi>The firſt thing thy Dark Mind ſtumbles at</hi> (ſays he to his Opponent <hi>Edward Dodd</hi>) <hi>is, that ſome have ſaid, that they that have the Spirit of God are</hi> Equal <hi>with God.

                  </hi>— But he ſeems to come into a calmer
<pb n="ccxlv" facs="tcp:32815:126"/>mood, a few lines after, and ſays, <hi>There is Equality in Nature, tho' not in Stature.</hi> But inſtead of bringing him off, this ſets him deeper in the Mire.

               <p>Having thus made themſelves <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual</hi> to God in very Nature, it is not ſtrange to ſee them denying any other <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> but themſelves. They pull <hi>God</hi> out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and upbraid thoſe who believe that there is any <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> there; as I have hereafter
<pb n="ccxlvi" facs="tcp:32815:127"/>Quoted their words, out of a Book of theirs call'd, <hi>The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 5. Your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your Carnal Chriſt is utterly deny'd</hi>— <hi>to ſay this Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon is a Lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will here add to this, how careful they are to inſtill into their Children, according to their Capacities, theſe Principles of their most <hi>Anti-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Religion; and exceeding the <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> of all that we ever yet heard among the moſt Barbarous of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Nations. There is a <hi>Primmer</hi> put out for the <hi>Quaker</hi> Children, by <hi>W. Smith.</hi> There, <hi>p. 8.</hi> you have this Queſtion asked, <hi>How may I know when Chriſt is truly Preached?</hi> And the Anſwer is, <hi>They that are
<pb n="ccxlvi" facs="tcp:32815:127"/>Falſe</hi> (Miniſters) <hi>Preach Chriſt without, and bid People believe in Him, as He is in Heaven above; but they that are Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Preach Chriſt within.</hi> Here was an admirable <hi>Cue</hi> given to young Children, to prevent their ever receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt tincture of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> that if they ſhou'd, at any time, hear of a <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or of any <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of themſelves, they might immediately ſtop their Ears, and believe all who ſpoke of it, to be <hi>Falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi> Sure, <hi>Satan</hi> never advanc'd his Kingdom in any Age ſo high, as in theſe miſerably Deluded People!</p>
               <p>But leſt the Child ſhou'd think that there might be only difference of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> betwixt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and others who Profeſs'd a Chriſt <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> tho' Preſent with
<pb n="ccxlviii" facs="tcp:32815:128"/>us, and operating in our <hi>Hearts</hi> by the <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of His <hi>Spirit;</hi> there is another Queſtion <hi>p. 9. Here then is great difference in their Doctrine?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>Yes, and no more Fellowſhip than Eaſt with Weſt.</hi> This Anſwer is true indeed. For the difference is not only in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> but in the <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And there is <hi>no more Fellowſhip than Eaſt with Weſt.</hi> But here take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that there are no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the World, who deny <hi>Chriſt<hi>'s Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
                  </hi> Influence and Operation in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, and His <hi>Light within</hi> them. And therefore this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Doctrine</hi> betwixt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> and us, which they ſay, is as wide as <hi>Eaſt</hi> from <hi>Weſt</hi> muſt be more than concerning the <hi>Light within,</hi> as a <hi>Ray</hi> or <hi>Beam</hi> ſhining into our
<pb n="ccxlix" facs="tcp:32815:128"/>Hearts from <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; for in this, there are none upon Earth that have any difference with them; and therefore, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt be concerning this <hi>Light within,</hi> being not a <hi>Beam,</hi> but the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf, the True, Real, and only <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The very <hi>Perſon,</hi> and not only the <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that the true ſtate of the Queſtion will be this, whether this <hi>Light within</hi> be the <hi>Principal</hi> or a <hi>Secondary</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in us? For if it be only a <hi>Beam,</hi> it is a <hi>Secondary</hi> Agent, becauſe it proceeds from the <hi>Sun;</hi> but if it be the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf, then it is <hi>Principal.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if it be the <hi>Sun,</hi> it is the only Agent, becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> receives not his Light from another. But if it be a <hi>Beam,</hi> it is not the only Agent; becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> does enlighten by the <hi>Beam.</hi>
                  <pb n="ccl" facs="tcp:32815:129"/>And, in both theſe reſpects, the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> do poſitively determine their <hi>Light within</hi> to be not a <hi>Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Agent, or ſent from any other; but that it is, <hi>its ſelf,</hi> the <hi>Only,</hi> and the <hi>Principle.</hi> And this is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which they betimes teach their Children. For in <hi>Smith's <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> p. 57.</hi> there is this Queſtion and Anſwer. <hi>And is that which is within you the <hi>Onely</hi> Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which you ſtand, and the <hi>Principle</hi> of your Religion?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>That of God</hi> within <hi>us, is ſo, for we know it is</hi> Chriſt; <hi>and being</hi> Chriſt, <hi>it muſt needs be</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>and</hi> Principal; <hi>for that which is</hi> Onely, <hi>admits not of another; and that which is</hi> Principal, <hi>is</hi> Greateſt <hi>in</hi> Being: <hi>And thus we know Chriſt</hi> in <hi>us to be unto us
<pb n="ccli" facs="tcp:32815:129"/>the <hi>Onely</hi> and the <hi>Principal,</hi> &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here they expreſly diſown any other <hi>Chriſt</hi> than what is <hi>within</hi> them. But becauſe all this may be pretended as meant only of Chriſt's <hi>Spirit,</hi> not of His <hi>Body,</hi> tho' there can be no room for any ſuch pretence, becauſe <hi>all whole Chriſt</hi> is here ſpoke of: And that it wou'd be as great <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> to ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spirit</hi> than what was <hi>within us,</hi> as to ſay that He had no other <hi>Body</hi> but what was <hi>within us:</hi> Yet, to make it exceeding plain that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> do not believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has any other <hi>Body,</hi> or other <hi>Humanity,</hi> than that <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Allegorical <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                  </hi> or whatever they mean by it, which they ſay He has <hi>within them.</hi> In <hi>Edw. Burrough's Works, p. 149.</hi>
                  <pb n="cclii" facs="tcp:32815:130"/>this Queſtion is ask'd, in theſe plain and peremptory Terms <hi>Is that very Man, with that very Body, within you, yea, or nay?</hi> And the Anſ. is as plain. <hi>The very Chriſt of God is within us, we dare not deny Him.</hi>

               <p>Purſuant to this Blaſphemus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> in a Sheet he Printed the <hi>17th</hi> of the ninth Month, <hi>1668.</hi> called, <hi>The Quakers Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, p. 6.</hi> ſays theſe words of <hi>G.

                  </hi> (George Fox) <hi>whom</hi> John <hi>ſaid he was not.</hi> This being objected by one <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> in his <hi>Queſtions to the Quakers, <hi>George Whitehead</hi>
                  </hi> makes this excuſe for it, in his <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="ccliii" facs="tcp:32815:130"/>Search,</hi> Printed <hi>1674. p. 58.</hi> he ſays that theſe words, <hi>The World was made by him,</hi> must not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to <hi>G.

But even this <hi>Arbitrary</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation will not do.

                  </hi> He ſaid, <hi>He was not the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </hi> He did not ſay, <hi>He was not <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
                  </hi> And therefore this cannot be apply'd to <hi>G. Fox</hi> any otherwiſe than by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

                  <hi>James Milner</hi> was judg'd to have a <hi>Pure Seed</hi> in him, notwithstanding of his <hi>Horrid Blaſphmy,</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophecies</hi> before-told.

               <p>The uſe I have to make of this, is not to <hi>Upbraid</hi> or <hi>Expoſe,</hi> but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> and all the ſober-minded among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> now at
<pb n="cclxi" facs="tcp:32815:134"/>laſt to conſider whither their ſtrange Pretences to <hi>Infallibility</hi> has led them. Even from the only <hi>Infallible Oracles</hi> now in the World, the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> by ſetting their <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> above the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> which they do, in refuſing to let their <hi>Light within</hi> be judg'd by the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> But, on the contrary, allowing no <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> have upon them, in any thing which is not likewiſe <hi>Dictated</hi> to them by their <hi>Light within:</hi> But thinking the <hi>Dictates</hi> of their <hi>Light within</hi> to be <hi>Obligatory</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> in things wherein the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> Alas! If that were all! Even in things where the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,</hi> and Command quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But, in the Authority which they have taken over the <hi>Letter</hi> of the
<pb n="cclxii" facs="tcp:32815:135"/>
                  <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they can over-rule every Command in <hi>Scripture,</hi> tho' in Terms never ſo Poſitive; as in the Caſe of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and many other Inſtances. Chiefly in that upon which I have ſo much inſisted, becauſe it is the Principal, their <hi>Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> away the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Promiſed Seed, The Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Satisfaction <hi>Thereby</hi>
                  </hi> made for our ſins; and his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and <hi>Mediation <hi>Therein</hi>
                  </hi> now at the Right Hand of his <hi>Father;</hi> to which we <hi>Dayly</hi> owe the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of his <hi>Bleſſed Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Adverſary</hi> cou'd never have gain'd this point upon them (which is the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) if he had not firſt Diſarm'd them of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistance of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> (wherein this is ſo <hi>mainly</hi> and ſo <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi>
                  <pb n="cclxiii" facs="tcp:32815:135"/>inſiſted upon) by perſuading them to take their own <hi>Light within</hi> for the <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> inſtead of the other.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Devil</hi> cannat keep his hold much longer than we ſhall return to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſubmit to them as our <hi>Rule.</hi> Which we may perceive by this, That no other <hi>Sect</hi> amongſt us, has run into this Exceſs of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the <hi>Quakers;</hi> becauſe no other has under valu'd the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſo much as they. What other ſort of Men that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have abus'd the <hi>Scriptures</hi> by the contemptible Names of <hi>Beaſtly Ware, Duſt, Death, Serpents-Meat,</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>Quakers?</hi> If they ſay, That this was only meant of the <hi>Letter;</hi> that is ſufficiently anſwer'd in what follows.
<pb n="cclxiv" facs="tcp:32815:136"/>But I have now to ask them, whether the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>their Writings</hi> be not as <hi>Beaſtly Ware,</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Scripture?</hi> And then, why they do not give the ſame <hi>Epithets</hi> to <hi>their Writings?</hi> No, no. Let them not Diſſemble the matter. They know very well, that the giving of <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Contemptible Names</hi> to any <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> can be for no other end, but to render the <hi>Contents</hi> of ſuch Writing, not the <hi>Letters, Ink,</hi> or the <hi>Paper, <hi>Vile</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Contemptible.</hi> And this is the Reaſon that they have taken ſuch care to ſecure the <hi>Honour</hi> of their own Writings; not only from ſuch <hi>Vile</hi> Names as they beſtow upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> but even from ſuch <hi>Names</hi> as are <hi>Honourable</hi> and of the <hi>Higheſt Eſtimation</hi> among <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Writings; ſuch, as <hi>Canons</hi> for

               <p>Here you ſee the World has not Language or <hi>Titles</hi> good enough for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor for their <hi>Writings. <hi>Edicts</hi>
                  </hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> are too <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>contemptible! <hi>Popes</hi>

<pb n="cclxvii" facs="tcp:32815:137"/>them! But while they thus vindicate their own <hi>Honour,</hi> and the no leſs than <hi>Divine</hi> Authority of their <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> at this <hi>Sublime</hi> ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You must not call <hi>their Writings</hi> by ſuch <hi>Slight</hi> and <hi>Contemptible</hi> Names, as <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Edicts</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> But you may call the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> by the not only much more <hi>Contemptible</hi> Names of <hi>Duſt</hi> and <hi>Beaſtly Ware,</hi> but the <hi>Curſed</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations of <hi>Carnal, Death,</hi> and the Meat of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> that is, the <hi>Devil!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, which of theſe ſeveral Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do teſtifie the greateſt <hi>Reſpect:</hi> And whether their <hi>Veneration</hi> does <hi>Hereby</hi> appear more to the <hi>Holy

               </p>
               <p>It is plain they never gave the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> a good word, but meerly for <hi>Popularity,</hi> when forc'd to it, to avoid the <hi>Odium</hi> of the World. And therefore, ſince the year <hi>1660.</hi> when the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and Her <hi>Liturgy</hi> brought the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> again into Requeſt, the <hi>Quakers</hi> have been more <hi>Phariſaical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Civil</hi> towards them; and, upon ſome Turns, will beſtow upon them the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithet</hi> of <hi>Holy;</hi> becauſe it is ſo common in the Mouths of other Men.</p>
               <p>But in all their <hi>Preachings</hi> or <hi>Writings</hi> before <hi>1660,</hi> where-ever they had occaſion to name the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
                  <pb n="cclxix" facs="tcp:32815:138"/>they ſeldom or never gave them that <hi>Epithet</hi> of <hi>Holy,</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> but plain <hi>Scriptures</hi> at beſt; tho' moſt commonly, they did not let them paſs without ſome of their <hi>ſweet</hi> Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before-told, of <hi>Beaſtly Ware, Serpent's Meat, Death,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> to beget the greater <hi>Reverence</hi> for them in the <hi>People!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is deſir'd, to Confute this Obſervation, that they wou'd give us what Citations they can (they will not be many) out of all their Books, which were wrote before <hi>1660.</hi> (and they are very numerous) which name the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with the Appellation of <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> or indeed with any ſort of <hi>Reſpect:</hi> Eſpecially let them Quote <hi>Fox, Burrough, Howgil,</hi> or ſome of their <hi>Principal Pillars.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="cclxx" facs="tcp:32815:139"/>
               <p>But if this Obſervation be <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and that they cannot diſprove it <hi>now;</hi> then let them take time, and put in ſuch Expreſſions, as oft as they pleaſe, in the <hi>New Edition</hi> of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Works, according to their Laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, before ſpoke of, to chop and change the Writings of their <hi>Dead Prophets,</hi> to anſwer the Exigency of the Times: Tho', if what they wrote was Dictated <hi>Immediately</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as they pretend, they are of Equal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and it muſt be as great a ſin to <hi>Add</hi> or <hi>Diminiſh</hi> in the Writings of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> themſelves. And then, by the Sentence pronounc'd, <hi>Rev. 22.18;</hi> and <hi>19.</hi> all thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall be <hi>Blotted</hi> out of the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> who, in the <hi>New Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Works of <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,

               </p>
               <p>And I have given them Lawful Warning not to incurr the like <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> in the new deſign'd Edition of their great Apoſtle <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s worthy <hi>Remains.</hi>

               <p>But, that they may not pretend <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> or <hi>Inadvertence,</hi> I do here particularly Caution, that the following Paſſages may not be <hi>left out,</hi> nor <hi>Blended,</hi> in a Book Publiſhed by <hi>Him,</hi> and other <hi>Quakers,</hi> call'd, <hi>The Weſt Anſwering to the North,</hi> Printed <hi>1657.</hi> where <hi>p. 7, 8.</hi> They tell, <hi>That <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Head was cut off, and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s, and <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>'s, as <hi>Traytors,</hi> for endeavouring to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws.</hi>

               <p>But there was a pleaſant Paſſage, which, I am confident, the <hi>Reader</hi> will Excuſe me to tell.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Draught of this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> approved by <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>This wou'd imply as if their <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> had been <hi>for him.</hi> For how otherwiſe was it any <hi>Merit</hi> in them, with regard to the <hi>King?</hi> Which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a piece of <hi>Groſs Hypocriſie,</hi> one <hi>Edward Billing</hi> (a <hi>Quaker</hi> of more open Sincerity and Courage than the rest) roſe up againſt it; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="cclxxxii" facs="tcp:32815:145"/>well that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had never <hi>Suffer'd,</hi> nor <hi>Acted</hi> any thing for the <hi>King;</hi> But, on the contrary, were always moſt bitter Enemies to Him, and to His Intereſts, he Protested against theſe words in the <hi>Declaration;</hi> and ſaid that it was a Mockery in the Face of the World, to give themſelves the ſtile of <hi>Loyal Subjects.</hi> But <hi>G. Fox</hi> and the Generality of the <hi>Quakers</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him; and thought it convenient that theſe Expreſſions ſhould ſtand; whereupon <hi>Billing,</hi> being heated, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd to them, that if they paſs'd the <hi>Declaration</hi> with theſe words, he wou'd <hi>Print</hi> againſt it, <hi>tho' it coſt him his Life.</hi> And this did ſo ſtartle them, (having a guilty Conſcience) that, to avoid being thus expos'd, they, at laſt, ſubmitted, to have theſe words left out; which they wou'd never have
<pb n="cclxxxiii" facs="tcp:32815:145"/>done, if they cou'd have ſtood the Teſt. But rather, ſuch an Objection, wou'd have made them more Zealous to have aſſerted their <hi>Loyalty</hi> with the greater vigor; and to have Cenſur'd this <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and caus'd, him to ſign an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Condemnation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, for ſo <hi>Foul,</hi> and at that time, <hi>Dangerous</hi> an <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> upon the whole Body of the <hi>Friends;</hi> And that ſo <hi>Publickly,</hi> in the Face of their Aſſembly, which they, according to their ſtated <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> have done in Caſes of much leſs Importance than this; and wou'd not have fail'd to have done in this, if they had not known his <hi>Charge</hi> to be <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Conteſt about the word <hi>Loyalty</hi> was perfectly needleſs, ſince they ſuffer'd the words which I have Quoted, to ſtand, <hi>viz. Truth and

               <p>One of their <hi>Mighty Prophets,</hi> (before and hereafter mentioned) height <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> came into the Church at <hi>Aldermanbury</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> in time of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> all <hi>Naked,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd up to the Elbows, with <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements;</hi> and other <hi>Quakers</hi> did justifie this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and ſaid that he might as well come into the Church with that <hi>Filth</hi> in his Hands, as the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> with a <hi>Bible.</hi> And he was, after this, very dear to <hi>G.

               <p>Upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 1681.</hi> at the <hi>Quaker-Meeting-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet,</hi> one, who had a greater Reverence for the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> than the reſt, brought a

                  <hi>Bible</hi> with him; and before the <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> was gathered, or their <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> come (ſo that it was no Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to their Publick Service) he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Gallery, read part of a Chapter, it was the <hi>14th</hi> of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſo nothing particular as to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they cou'd take notice of: But it was the <hi>Bible!</hi> And that was a ſight not us'd to be ſeen there, much leſs to hear it read; which ſo mov'd their Indignation, that one of the Chief of them ſnatch'd the <hi>Bible</hi> out of his Hand, and (notwithſtanding of all their <hi>Meekneſs</hi>) thruſt him (an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and <hi>Grave</hi> Man) all along the Gallery, down ſeveral ſteps. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Smith</hi> was preſent, and will attest it.</p>
               <p>But that this may not ſeem ſtrange to the Reader, he muſt know that
<pb n="cccxxiv" facs="tcp:32815:166"/>there never was, from their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the World, one <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> read in any of their <hi>Meetings.</hi> No, nor has any of their <hi>Preachers,</hi> that I cou'd hear of, to this Day, ever recommended the reading of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> to their People; but rather lead them from it, as from a <hi>Dead Letter;</hi> which was <hi>Hurtful</hi> and <hi>Pernicious:</hi> and that they ſhou'd mind only their own <hi>Light within;</hi> that is, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own <hi>Imaginations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wou'd not that Argument of minding only their own <hi>Light within,</hi> conclude as much againſt reading the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Quaker</hi> Writings?</p>
               <p>O, no, that was far from their meaning! For, having thus taken the People off from reading or minding the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> the <hi>Fetch</hi> which
<pb n="cccxxv" facs="tcp:32815:166"/>the <hi>Devil</hi> had in this, was to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the <hi>Rankeſt Poiſon</hi> in lieu of that <hi>Heavenly Manna,</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore this <hi>Grand Deceiver</hi> Poſſeſs'd the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> with that <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> as well as <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> That when, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Light within,</hi> he had drawn them away from reading of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> yet, upon the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he made them Zealous for the Reading and Studying of <hi>their own Writings;</hi> as if the Pretended <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of their <hi>Light within,</hi> were not as much overthrown by the one, as by the other. But this plainly diſcovers their Preference of <hi>their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> to the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> that, while they rejected the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as not <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to the <hi>Guidance</hi> or <hi>Direction</hi> of their <hi>Light within;</hi>
                  <pb n="cccxxvi" facs="tcp:32815:167"/>they, at the ſame time, enjoin'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeverest Penalties, even of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Authority of God Himſelf, not only the <hi>Private Studying,</hi> but the <hi>Publick Reading</hi> of <hi>their own Writings,</hi> in their <hi>Meetings.</hi> Thus their Great <hi>Fox</hi> Commands. <hi>This is the Word of the Lord</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I charge you, in the Preſence of the Lord God, to ſend this</hi> (Epiſtle) <hi>amongſt all Friends and Brethren every where, to be read in all Meetings.

               <p>But this by the bye. To return to <hi>Edw. Burrough p. 47.</hi> of his Works, determines clearly, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not <hi>now</hi> of any Authority at all to us, <hi>at this day.</hi> Why? Becauſe they were Commands given to <hi>others,</hi> and not to <hi>us.</hi> For example, That the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> bound no other Church; that to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> had reſpect only to thoſe of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> and ſo of all the reſt. And that the old <hi>Prophets</hi> were only to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to at that time, by thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="cccxxxix" facs="tcp:32815:173"/>
                  <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Nations,</hi> to whom they then directed their Prophecies. For it being objected, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> held this pernicious Principle, <hi>That the Saints were not to do Duties by or from a Command without, but from a</hi> Command <hi>within; and that the word Command in Scripture, was not a Command to them; till they had the word within them. <hi>Burrough</hi>
                  </hi> owns and juſtifies it. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>That is no Command from God to me, which he Commands to another; neither did any of the Saints which we read of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, act by the Command which was to another, not having the Command to themſelves; I Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge an Example of it; they obey'd every one their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb n="cccxl" facs="tcp:32815:174"/>and thou or any other, who goes to Duty, as you call it, by Imitation from the Letter without, which was Commands to others— your Sacrifice is not accepted, but is Abomination to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here it is made <hi>Abomination to the Lord,</hi> to obey the Command of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or to live by <hi>Imitation,</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>from the Letter;</hi> that is, not to follow our own <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> without the controul of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or any other <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſame Principle which is hereafter, <hi>p. 156.</hi> related from Mr. <hi>Penn;</hi> and almost in the ſame words, That <hi>what was a Command of God, in old time</hi> (that is, in the Scriptures) <hi>is not ſo to us, unleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by the ſame Spirit <hi>Anew.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="cccxli" facs="tcp:32815:174"/>Here the whole Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> is, at one blow cut down. For no Command in <hi>Scripture</hi> is, by this Rule, obligatory, unleſs it be Commanded <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> by the <hi>Quaker <hi>Light within</hi>
                  </hi> (that is, by every Man's <hi>Roving Imagination</hi>) and, if it be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their <hi>Light within,</hi> then they think that it is Dictated by the ſame Spirit, which gave forth the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of old; and, <hi>upon that account only,</hi> that it is <hi>obligatory;</hi> but not becauſe it is contain'd in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> which was only a Command to thoſe in former Ages, but not to us who have another Rule given unto us <hi>Anew;</hi> that is, our own <hi>Light within.</hi> So that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are, by this, as much <hi>out-dated,</hi> as an old <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack.</hi> And we muſt no longer <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> we muſt not live ſo
<pb n="cccxlii" facs="tcp:32815:175"/>much as by <hi>Imitation</hi> of what we find there. <hi>Burrough</hi> ſays, it is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, it was no ſtrange thing to hear <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Serious Apology, p. 49.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not only their <hi>Writings,</hi> but their <hi>Extempore <hi>Preachments,</hi>
                  </hi> and even all whatſoever they <hi>ſpeak,</hi> upon any account, to the <hi>Holy Scriptures themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion demanded was this, <hi>Do you eſteem your</hi> Speakings <hi>to be of as great Authority as any Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Bible?</hi> And his <hi>Anſwer</hi> is in theſe words, <hi>That which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and <hi>Greater.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="cccxliii" facs="tcp:32815:175"/>
               <p>And therefore, tho' they have let no ſuppos'd contempt of their own Books go unrebuked (as in the Inſtance before of <hi>Chandler</hi>) yet we never heard of any <hi>Cenſure</hi> they have paſs'd upon thoſe many much groſſer contempts of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which daily are found among them. Particularly (that we may always name ſome Instance) of <hi>Mary Tucker</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> Servant to <hi>William Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> a <hi>Barber,</hi> now living in <hi>Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, Cheap-ſide,</hi> but formerly in <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> where this <hi>Mary,</hi> then his Servant, took the <hi>Bible,</hi> and, in the open day, publickly <hi>Burnt</hi> it, againſt the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> to ſhew her <hi>Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Purſuant to this their Principle, in their Diſputes among themſelves, they appeal to their own <hi>Writings,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Thus when
<pb n="cccxliv" facs="tcp:32815:176"/>in their Publick Meeting, at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> upon <hi>Sunday 11. Dec. 1692. G. Keith</hi> was Accus'd of <hi>Hereſie,</hi>

               <p>And, I may, perhaps, preſent him with a further Examination of the above-ſaid <hi>Quaker-Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Seven Quaeries,</hi> of their waving to Anſwer, as to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> wherein they dare not deny themſelves to be direct <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and of ſome other Material Points, which I will not inſiſt upon, in this, that has already ſwell'd ſo much beyond its firſt intended bounds.</p>
               <p>Only I do <hi>now</hi> give this Caution to thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> who ſhall be ordain'd to Anſwer this Book (if they ſo think fit) that they ſerve it not as they have done the <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> before-told; but that they wou'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſtinctly to each <hi>Section</hi> by its ſelf:
<pb n="cccxlii" facs="tcp:32815:180"/>And not Anſwer a Book as <hi>Rats</hi> do, by nibbling at ſome corners of the Leaves; ſtealing through it like <hi>Moths,</hi> to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe than to deface ſome <hi>Words</hi> at a venture, without any need ſo much as to open the Book, or examine into the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, let them paſs it, in <hi>Silence.</hi> and that ſhall be taken for a full <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the <hi>Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if they will Anſwer, I deſire that they wou'd (for Brevity, and to give us a taſte of their Spirit) begin with a plain <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> to the <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Seven Quaeries,</hi> which are above inſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Sixth.</hi> Theſe are not ſo <hi>Long,</hi> nor ſo <hi>Intricate,</hi> as not to admit of a Plain <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> in Anſwer to them: But if the <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſe this, or ſhall over again, after all this <hi>Caution,</hi> give only a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Evaſive</hi> Anſwer: Then I ſhall Conclude, and I believe, all the <hi>Readers</hi> with me, That nothing fair is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them, or to be expected in their Anſwers to all the reſt of this Book: And that they are not <hi>ſound in the Faith.</hi>

            <p>THE Controverſie with the <hi>Quaker-Diſſenters,</hi> has not been purſu'd by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> with the like
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32815:181"/>Zeal and Pains as thoſe againſt the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> were not ſo Conſiderable, either for their <hi>Learning,</hi> or for their Influence upon the Publick <hi>Revolutions,</hi> which the others caus'd both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their Numbers (whether increas'd by being ſo neglected) are now really <hi>Formidable,</hi> I mean for the many <hi>Souls</hi> Seduc'd by them (for I ſpeak not now of <hi>Temporal</hi> Conſiderations;) they not only ſwarm over theſe Three Nations, but they Stock our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations abroad.</p>
            <p>It is wholly for the love of <hi>Souls,</hi> that I have enter'd into this Controverſie. And therefore, to do Right to All, I have made a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32815:181"/>Diſtinction between them, in the very <hi>Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I name many of their <hi>Principal Leaders;</hi> becauſe I have great Charity for the generality of the Ignorant ſort of them, ſome of whom I know to be very <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Well-meaning</hi> Men, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> in their way, and who ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing of the <hi>Depth</hi> of that <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> wherein they are <hi>Blindly,</hi> and <hi>Implicitly</hi> led. And therefore it is chiefly for the ſake of theſe, that I detect the Errors of their <hi>Leaders</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> that they may, now at length, if it be the Will of God, recover themſelves out of the Snares of the Devil, wherein they are taken Captive by him at his will.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32815:182"/>
            <p>Secondly, I name the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of theſe <hi>Rabbies</hi> of the <hi>Quakers Sect.</hi> For, tho' they are generally thought the moſt <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> Sect amongſt all our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters;</hi> and therefore are moſt neglected by us; yet, ſince I have perus'd their Books, and Convers'd with ſome of them, I have much alter'd my Opinion as to that.</p>
            <p>I find them to Inherit the <hi>Subtilty</hi> as well as <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who were the moſt <hi>Subtile</hi> and hardeſt to be Detected, of any of the <hi>Christian Hereticks.</hi> And the <hi>Quakers</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves with the ſame <hi>Distinctions,</hi> and even add to their Arts, as you ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p>But they are now at a very hard Lock. For many of them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32815:182"/>have really gone off from the height of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> which was Profeſs'd among them at their firſt ſetting up, in the Year 1650. and ſo continu'd till after the Reſtauration <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. ſince which time they have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off by degrees; eſpecially of late, ſome of them have made nearer Advances towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity than ever before: And among them the Ingenious Mr: <hi>Penn</hi> has of late refin'd ſome of their groſs Notions, and brought them into ſome Form, has made them ſpeak <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of both which <hi>George Fox</hi> (their Firſt and Great Apoſtle) was totally Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as you will ſee in the few Quotations, which I have Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd out of his <hi>Great Myſtery</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32815:183"/>his own words. But ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is their State, that tho' they have in a great meaſure, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd from the Errors of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet they will not own this; becauſe, as they think, it wou'd Reflect upon their whole Profeſſion, as indeed it does, and Argues that their Doctrine was Errouneous from the Beginning; and their Pretence Falſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, upon which they firſt left the <hi>Church,</hi> and run into <hi>Schiſm:</hi> Therefore they endeavour, all they can, to make it appear that their Doctrine was Uniform from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that there has been no alteration; and therefore they take upon them to defend all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and others of the firſt <hi>Quakers,</hi> and turn and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32815:183"/>wind them, to make them (but it is impoſſible) agree with what they Teach now at this day.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, they have, by theſe Arts brought back their <hi>New Reformation</hi> to the <hi>Old Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard;</hi> and while they wou'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile,</hi> they, in effect, <hi>Justifie</hi> and ſtill <hi>Maintain</hi> their firſt <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Pretences; only have Dreſs'd and Couch'd them more <hi>Craftily,</hi> which is more <hi>Wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, to rid them out of this Difficulty, I wou'd perſuade them, openly and above-board to Renounce <hi>George Fox</hi> and their <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> and all their <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> and <hi>Heretical Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which whoever refuſes to do, muſt be concluded to remain ſtill in that <hi>Root of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32815:184"/>
            <p>For this Reaſon I have taken my Riſe from the Writings of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and others of their <hi>Scribes;</hi> and ſhewn the little, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſtinctions, which the <hi>Modern Quakers</hi> make uſe of, to Cover, Palliate, and Reconcile thoſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils</hi> at firſt taught by them.</p>
            <p>And I hope I have perform'd thus much, That our <hi>preſent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> muſt either plainly Renounce <hi>George Fox,</hi> and other their <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rabbi's;</hi> or otherwiſe that they are not to be believ'd in that fair Face which they, at preſent, wou'd put upon their <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo <hi>Monſtrous</hi> or ſo <hi>Senſeleſs</hi> for which excuſes may not be made, and ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly plauſible meaning put upon the groſſeſt Abſurdities.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32815:184"/>
            <p>No <hi>Quakers</hi> in the World do Defend themſelves with greater vehemence, and ſelf-aſſurance than the <hi>Muggletonians</hi> do.</p>
            <p>And they go (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do) upon the Pretence of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> Inſpiration of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> or, the <hi>Light within;</hi> and are as Poſitive as any <hi>Quaker</hi> of them all.</p>
            <p>And, I muſt ſay it, they give the ſame Proof for their <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Inſpiration, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, that is, none at all, but their own Confident averring of it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Penn,</hi> in his <hi>Winding-Sheet</hi> (hereafter Quoted) p. 6 <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. calls <hi>Muggleton</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer of our Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I wou'd beſeech Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> (who has more Wit than all the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32815:185"/>reſt of his Party) to let us know what Ground he had for leaving the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> more than <hi>Muggleton?</hi> Or, than others of the <hi>Separate Quakers</hi> have for leaving of him, and his Party?</p>
            <p>Or why we ſhou'd truſt the <hi>Light</hi> within <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>George Fox,</hi> rather than the <hi>Light</hi> within <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Muggleton?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Has <hi>Lodowick</hi> wrought no <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> to prove his Miſſion? No more have <hi>George Fox,</hi> or <hi>William Penn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are they very ſure that they are in the Right? So is he. Are they <hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi> So is he. Are they above <hi>Ordinances?</hi> Have they thrown off the <hi>Sacraments? Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton</hi> has done more: He has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> too:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32815:185"/>For theſe are <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Is <hi>He</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſtinct <hi>Perſons</hi> in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? So are <hi>They.</hi> Is <hi>He</hi> againſt all <hi>Creeds?</hi> So are <hi>They.</hi> Does <hi>He</hi> deny all <hi>Church-Authority?</hi> So do <hi>They.</hi> Yet does <hi>He</hi> require the moſt Abſolute Submiſſion to what <hi>Himſelf</hi> teaches? So do <hi>They.</hi> Does <hi>He</hi> make a <hi>Dead Letter</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and Reſolve all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Private Spirit? So do <hi>They.</hi> Does <hi>He</hi> Damn all the World; and all ſince the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> So do <hi>They.</hi> All which will be ſhewn at large in what follows. Theſe are <hi>Twin-Enthuſiaſts,</hi> both born in the year 1650. (for then it was <hi>Muggleton</hi> ſays he got his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration) and have proceeded ſince upon the ſame main Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tho' in ſome particulars, they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32815:186"/>have out-ſtript one another, and Perſecute one another, as if they were not Brethren: But tho', like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, they draw two ways, their Tails are joyn'd with Fire-brands, to ſet the Church in a Flame.</p>
            <p>I deſire here, before I go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to obviate a Prejudice which ſome Readers may take as a little <hi>Railery</hi> I am forc'd to, now and then; which they may think not becoming the Gravity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in Hand: But there are ſome things ſo very Ridiculous, as to make a <hi>ſerious</hi> Confutation of them no leſs Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>I am to tell the Reader, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that I do not, in this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to give an Account of all the Errors of the <hi>Quakers:</hi> And

               <p>I Will diſpatch this Head, with a pleaſant Story I find in the Printed Tryals of <hi>G.

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:32815:187"/>of theirs. This put them into great Diſtreſs, betwixt their ſo much cry'd up Principle againſt uſing outward Force, tho' in their own Defence; which a whole <hi>Dozen</hi> of them, and <hi>George Fox</hi> the firſt, Sign'd in a Declaration to K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. in the year 1660. to be <hi>Anti-Chriſtian;</hi> which <hi>Declaration</hi> is inſerted in the ſaid Tryal, with other Teſtimonies of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt even <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> tho' to ſave their <hi>Throats</hi> or <hi>Goods</hi> from <hi>Thieves, Robbers</hi> and <hi>Cut-Throats</hi> (I uſe their own words) as being <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and a <hi>Miſtruſting</hi> of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Reſtraining Evil Men.</hi> They were in great pain how to ſave this <hi>Principle</hi> and the <hi>Sloop</hi> too.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32815:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>might have gone the ſame way, if they wou'd not oppoſe Force to Force: which at laſt was reſolv'd upon, and they re-took their <hi>Sloop,</hi> and made ſome of the <hi>Pirates</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. They ſoon found that neceſſity in Government, when it was in their own Hands, which they cou'd not be convinc'd of while it was in the Hands of others.</p>
               <p>But they muſt not go from any former Principle, for ſpoyling of their <hi>Infallibility:</hi> Therefore they Coyn'd, or Borrow'd a pretty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and ſaid that they did not uſe the <hi>Carnal Weapon,</hi> as <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> but as <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> And now all is whole again.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32815:208"/>that is, that God Created it: But that it came <hi>of</hi> God, as a <hi>Part</hi> of God, of his <hi>Subſtance, Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Eſſence.</hi> And, p. 100. <hi>is not this of God's Being?</hi> Says he.

                  <hi>Light within is Chriſt.</hi> p. 310.

                  <hi>Thou</hi> (ſays he to his Opponent, p. 96.) <hi>not being <hi>Infallible,</hi> thou art not in the Spirit, and ſo art not a Miniſter, and art not able to judge of Powers that is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> nor</hi> Magiſtrates, <hi>nor</hi> Kingdoms, <hi>nor</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>Now which of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is it who have this <hi>Spirit,</hi> to judge thus <hi>Infallibly</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> of <hi>Powers, Magistrates, Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Churches?</hi> And to diſcern Mens Hearts, who are <hi>Saints</hi> and who <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and that without being told by any, as <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>This is told us in p. 7. of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burrough</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader</hi> of <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> where he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32815:216"/>ſays, that this <hi>Infallible</hi> Spirit was given. <hi>To us</hi> (ſays he) <hi>every one of us in particular</hi>— <hi>And this <hi>Light</hi> gave us to diſcern between Truth and Error, between every falſe and right way, and it</hi> Perfectly <hi>diſcover'd to us the true ſtate of <hi>All Things.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Thou ſay'ſt (<hi>ſays</hi> Fox <hi>to his Opponent,</hi> p. 107.) that the Holieſt Man is not able to give an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> Character of another Man: Haſt thou not in this diſcover'd thy ſelf to be no Miniſter of Chriſt, or of the Spirit? Who cannot give an <hi>Infallible</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of another Man, how canſt thou Miniſter to his Condition? How canſt thou ſee where he is? How canſt thou ſee them that be turned from the Darkneſs, and that be in the Darkneſs, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32815:216"/>diſtinguiſh the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and an Holy Man from an Unholy Man, that canſt not give an <hi>Infallible</hi> Character of and Man's Eſtate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> p. 94. <q>Have ye given your ſelves a Name of the Church of Chriſt, and is there not a Spirit of diſcerning among you? Have ye not manifeſted here that ye are <hi>Harlotted</hi> from the Church of Chriſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were of? And how can ye Miniſter or Teach People, if ye do not diſcern their ſtates, how they ſtand before God? How can you commend your ſelves to every Man's Conſcience in God's ſight? How can ye preſent the Souls of Men to God, and ſee not their ſtates
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32815:217"/>how they are in his ſight? How come ye to have Fellowſhip in the Spirit? How can you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſter to the ſtate and condition that People be in, and ſee where they are, and doth not ſee how they ſtand in God's ſight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all from the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> from having any <hi>Fellowſhip in the Spirit,</hi> who have not this <hi>Infallible</hi> Spirit of diſcerning every Man's Heart.</p>
               <p>And it is evident (as I will ſhew preſently) that they did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>George Keith, Francis Bugg,</hi> and many others, whom, for many years they own'd as true <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome of them as <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> among them, and boaſted a

               </p>
               <p>Page 33. He that is not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in his Council, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Advice, is not he in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? And are they <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt that are Fallable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 105. <hi>G. Fox</hi> condemns all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, as well as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for want of this <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> aſcribe only to themſelves. Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ſays he</hi> (the Pope) <hi>and you</hi> (the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi>)

               </p>
               <p>This is dreadfully Aſtoniſhing! But I was much more ſurpriz'd to find the otherwiſe Ingenious <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn</hi> laugh at his Adverſary for not being <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was an Anonymous Book wrote againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> call'd, <hi>Controverſy Ended;</hi> to this Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> Reply'd in a Sheet of large Paper in Print, which he Entituled, <hi>A Winding-Sheet for Controverſy Ended,</hi> which bears Date the 16 of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32815:218"/>12th. <hi>Month,</hi> 1672. In the firſt page, he catches up the Author, (whom he calls <hi>Henry Hedworth</hi>) for ſaying that he had been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the good Opinion he had before of Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Judgment and Conſcience. <hi>How can he chuſe</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>) <hi>who denies <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility?</hi> But if miſtaken before, why not in the Quakers now? And ſo</hi> ad Infinitum, <hi>being ſo <hi>Fallible.</hi>
                  </hi> And, p 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. He Vindicates what <hi>George Fox</hi> had aſſerted of the <hi>Quakers <hi>Infallibility;</hi>
                  </hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Repeated theſe words of <hi>G.

And how can they but Delude the People, who are not Infallible?</hi> He makes this Reply. <hi>I Anſwer</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:32815:219"/>(ſays he) G. F's <hi>words ſtand immovable for ever.</hi> And he gives this ſtrange Reaſon to ſupport himſelf and <hi>G. F.</hi> For, ſays he, <hi>He that is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Spirit, is <hi>Infallibly</hi> for And in that Ministry, is <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> otherwiſe the Spirit's Miniſtry is <hi>Fallible.</hi>
                  </hi> Which is ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as this, that if any Man, who is lighted by the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or miſs his way, the fault is in the <hi>Sun,</hi> which ſhew'd him a <hi>Falſe Light.</hi> What elſe can be the meaning of that ſaying, that if a <hi>Miniſter</hi> be not <hi>Infallible,</hi> then the Miniſtry of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Fallible?</hi> To make <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>Fallible,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we ſhou'd not be <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he comes quite off of this again in the next page and Sect.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32815:219"/>And this, ſays he, <hi>Roundly checks his</hi> (Hen.

               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Henry Hedworth</hi> is made <hi>Infallible</hi> too! Whom, in this ſame <hi>Winding-Sheet</hi> (as above Quoted) he calls <hi>a very Night-Bird,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, Burſten'd</hi> with <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> a <hi>Buſie-Body, Cavelling, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, Proud, Wrathful, Equivocating, Slandering, Cowardly Man,</hi> &amp;c. all which Epiſtles, and all the reſt

               </p>
               <p>Nay, the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> at this rate, for he has his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well as <hi>Being</hi> from <hi>God; Knowledge</hi> is <hi>Light:</hi> and if that <hi>Knowledge</hi> which comes from <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> then while the <hi>Devil</hi> follows that <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> he muſt be <hi>Infallible:</hi> And if this be all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> aſcribe to themſelves, it diſtinguiſhes them not from <hi>Wicked Men</hi> or <hi>Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſure <hi>George Fox</hi> meant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more by it, when by it, he diſtinguiſh'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> from all other ſorts of Men; and aſcrib'd to them an <hi>Infallible</hi> Diſcerning
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32815:220"/>Spirit, to know the Hearts of Men, <hi>without ſpeaking ever a word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which I wiſh Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> wou'd afford us, I will not ſay an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> but an <hi>Intelligible</hi> Comment; for I proteſt, I ſay not this out of any Obſtinacy or Perverſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but to be able to apprehend, if poſſible, what theſe Men wou'd be at: For they turn and wind this <hi>Infallibility</hi> of theirs at ſuch a rate, that no Man can (I am ſure cannot) know what they mean by it. Sometimes it makes them as <hi>Infallible</hi> as the <hi>Apostles,</hi> nay, as <hi>Chriſt Himſelf.</hi> But at other times, when they are preſs'd, they bring down this <hi>Infallibility</hi> to mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World that does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from other Men: Tho' it was upon the pretence of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32815:221"/>this, that they did ſeparate them ſelves from the <hi>Church,</hi> and from all other Men: For they ſaid that they ought not to be <hi>Subject</hi> to, nor had need to be <hi>Guided</hi> by any <hi>Church,</hi> who had an <hi>Infallible Guide</hi> within their own Breaſts; that is, each <hi>Particular Perſon</hi> for himſelf, as before is told.</p>
               <p>But this pretence is now explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Separate Quakers;</hi> and Explain'd, at ſome turns, by the others, as above by Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> to mean <hi>juſt nothing;</hi> that is, nothing which differences them from other Men; or any thing New, or other than what all Mankind have ever acknowledg'd, <hi>to wit,</hi> Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this will no more prove it to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> or Sufficient, of it ſelf, to bring us to <hi>Heaven,</hi> than it will follow that Man cannot die, becauſe God Breathes into him the Breath of <hi>Life;</hi> or that he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Strength</hi> comes from God. <hi>Omniſcence</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> is as much <hi>God</hi>'s Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as <hi>Omnipotence:</hi> And the <hi>Strength</hi> which God has given to our <hi>Bodies</hi> is as ſufficient to climb up to the <hi>Skies,</hi> as the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> which He has given to our <hi>Souls</hi> was ſufficient, of it ſelf, to have found out the Redemption of Loſt Man, by the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to God's <hi>Juſtice</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:32815:222"/>for our ſins; or if found out, to have paid that Price, and to have accompliſhed that whole won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by our own Abilities: So very <hi>Inſufficient</hi> is the <hi>Light within us,</hi> even tho' follow'd to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, by its own ſtrength, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us to Heaven. And therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> Preaching up the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of the <hi>Light within</hi> (as all of them, but the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> do) is not only highly Derogatory to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> paid by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our ſins: But it is <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> in aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to our ſelves a Power <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to work out our own <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> whereas no <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> leſs than <hi>Infinite,</hi> cou'd have found out the <hi>Means,</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> leſs than <hi>Infinite</hi> cou'd have <hi>Effected</hi> our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:32815:222"/>
               <p>And tho' we are Commanded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. to <hi>work out our own Salvation,</hi> that is, to perform the Conditions which are requir'd on our Part. That does not make the <hi>Light within</hi> the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of our Salvation, or give it any Title to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> more than <hi>ver.</hi> 13. of the 4th <hi>Chap.</hi> in the ſame <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> can Entitle us to <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays there, I <hi>can do all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any cou'd pretend to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> from the Countenance of ſome <hi>Texts</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> they will be found to have the beſt Title to whom the <hi>Quakers</hi> wou'd moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly grant it. For it is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.10. <hi>A Divine Sentence is in the Lips of the</hi> King, <hi>and his Mouth Tranſgreſſeth not in Judgment.</hi>

               <p>I fanſie I hear <hi>George Whitehead</hi> anſwering of this Text thus.

               <p>If he think that this is making too bold with him, I learn'd it from himſelf in his Sheet call'd, <hi>A Charitable Eſſay,</hi> Printed in Anſwer to <hi>Fr.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32815:226"/>Sign'd a Paper of Condemnation of himſelf for this wicked Fact, Dated in <hi>Norwich</hi> Gaol the 3d Day of the 5th Month, 1655. and gave it, as an Act of Penance, and of the Sincerity of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to three Friends, <hi>John Stubbs, VVilliam Cotton,</hi> and <hi>Tho.

               </p>
               <p>But theſe not regarding the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of the Seal of <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> or being not acquainted with it; and fearing that this wou'd be known, and ſo reflect upon the <hi>in-errable</hi> Society, and preferring their own Honour, to the Honour of God, and the Reſtoring of a Laps'd Brother, did reſolve to Reveal his Confeſſion, and then Renounce him; which they did (and pretended that it was by the ſpecial Direction of God) by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>The above-written being declar'd to me, I am mov'd of the Lord to make it known to you that are the Rulers of this City, that the Truth of God may be cleared, and he to bear his own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who hath done this wicked Deed, which is hated of them that dwell in the Light.</p>

               <p>But now, how do you think they contriv'd to ſalve their <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> that cou'd not find out this of <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> till he told it himſelf?</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:32815:227"/>
               <p>Why! moſt Cleverly! As we have it in another Letter of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>R. Hubberthorne</hi> to <hi>E. B. F. H. Ger. Roberts,</hi> and the reſt, from <hi>Giſsing,</hi> the 5th Day of the 5th Month, 1655. wherein he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this Confeſſion of <hi>C. A</hi>'s to a miraculous Force upon him from God, and againſt his own Will. And therefore we are left to ſuppoſe <hi>(if we pleaſe)</hi> that it was obtain'd by their Prayers. His words are theſe. <hi>VVhen it was intended by them</hi> (Chriſtopher Atkinſon <hi>and the Maid</hi>) <hi>to have been hid, they were forced from the witneſs of God in them to Declare it, and own their Condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here was a greater <hi>Miracle</hi> than if they had found it out of themſelves; if they could prevail
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32815:227"/>with God to force the very Guilty Parties to confeſs it, againſt their own Wills.</p>
               <p>And therefore no thanks to them— And therefore theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Confeſſors</hi> were not bound to Conceal the <hi>Confeſsion</hi> which <hi>C. A.</hi> made to them in Priſon; nor to ſeek to Reſtore him, but rather to Drive him farther into Deſpair, by quite throwing him off, and diſowning him.</p>
               <p>There was much more tender Regard ſhew'd to ſome <hi>Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who had given a <hi>Confeſsion</hi> in <hi>VVriting</hi> to <hi>John Bolton</hi> of their Frailty in the Fleſh, as is told in the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> Printed, 1673. p. 43. but it was huſh'd up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as the <hi>Quaker</hi> Author De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares) <hi>it touched many Eminent ones in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32815:228"/>the Ministery; who from day to day reſorted unto them, and giving them theſe Appellations: <hi>Innocent Laſſes, and Daughters of Sion.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtances can likewiſe be given of ſome of their <hi>She-Preachers</hi> (whom they call <hi>Traveling Friends</hi>) that went abroad to propagate the <hi>Faith,</hi> and to ſettle the <hi>Churches,</hi> who got ſomething in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which made them <hi>Propagate</hi> and <hi>Travail,</hi> even according to the <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not good Manners to name Names upon ſuch an Occaſion. Yet, if the <hi>Friends</hi> will plead Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſomething may be done for their Satisfaction. But let the ſhame lie at their own Door. It is but ask and have.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:32815:228"/>
               <p>But we may make a little more bold with the <hi>Mens</hi> Infallibility. And I will not go to <hi>Mean</hi> ones. The great <hi>James Naylor</hi> was brought upon his Knees before their Church, where <hi>George Fox</hi> Preſided, to acknowledge his <hi>Failings.</hi> And I ſaw, in <hi>George Fox</hi>'s own Hand, this Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>James Naylor,</hi> viz. <hi>Friends ſhall not be judged, for judging of him, J. N.</hi> This was preſerv'd by one preſent (among many others) when he wrote it. This <hi>James Naylor</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf to be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna'd</hi> into <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> was into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And I have told you before of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s aſcribing not only the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> to himſelf; and others of their <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32815:229"/>Invoking</hi> and <hi>Worſhiping</hi> him, as <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are much more dreadful <hi>Failings</hi> than thoſe (before ſpoke of) of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>W. W.</hi> of <hi>Hallelujah Fiſh</hi> (the <hi>Saints</hi> know whom I mean) and ſeveral others whom I cou'd name. And I had not mention'd one ſingle Perſon, if it had not been againſt Pretenders to <hi>Infallibility;</hi> which Plea leads us Naturally and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily into this ſort of Redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gution: as giving a Man a <hi>Fall</hi> is the ſhorteſt and plaineſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that he is not <hi>Almighty.</hi> And I am very ſure that all the knowing among the <hi>Quakers</hi> will believe that it was meerly the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Argument which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32815:229"/>forc'd me to expoſe the <hi>Failings</hi> of any; for that if it had proceeded from any Inveteracy or Malice, Catalogues might have Been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, inſtead of ſingle Inſtances here ſet down, and thoſe at great Diſtance.</p>
               <p>But I hope what has been ſaid will be ſufficient (and then it has reach'd my Purpoſe) to cure Men of this moſt miſtaken pretence to <hi>Infallibility;</hi> grounded upon the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Spirit of God: as if nothing cou'd proceed from <hi>Infallibility</hi> but what was <hi>Infallible;</hi> or from <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> but what was it ſelf <hi>Omnipotent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' God <hi>Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> did Create all things that are; yet there is <hi>VVeakneſs, Error,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> in the World.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:32815:230"/>
               <p>Of all which there is not any Inſtance ſo great, as of thoſe who deny this, who are not ſenſible of their own <hi>VVeakneſs</hi> and <hi>Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> but pretend to <hi>Perfection</hi> and that even <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let ſuch conſider, that it is a juſt Judgment from God, to give up thoſe to follow their own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, who, of their own Heads, durſt preſume to leave thoſe Guides (the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) under whoſe Government God had plac'd them; and to rend the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and Deſperate Schiſm.</p>
               <p>So that even their <hi>Error</hi> may, in this Senſe, come from <hi>God,</hi> that is, as a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for this cauſe</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11.) <hi>God ſhall ſend them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32815:230"/>ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Lye. And if the Prophet be deceived</hi> (Ezek. 14.9.) <hi>I the Lord have deceived that Prophet.</hi> And it was <hi>the Lord</hi> who put a <hi>Lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> into the Mouths of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> 1 Kings, 22.23. Now whether it be <hi>ſuch a Spirit</hi> or not, which is in the Mouths of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Prophets,</hi> we have a plain Rule whereby to know, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, 20, 21, 22. <hi>The Prophet which ſhall preſume to ſpeak a word in my Name, which I have not Commanded him to ſpeak—even that Prophet ſhall die. And if thou ſay in thine Heart, how ſhall we know the word which the Lord hath not ſpoken? VVhen a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32815:231"/>not ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it Preſumptuouſly; thou ſhall not be afraid of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a plain Touch-ſtone, which cannot be miſtaken. And the caſe of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is ſo hard, that if we can prove but one <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> among them, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of all and every one of them muſt be a Deceit; becauſe (as above-quoted out of <hi>Ed. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>) the <hi>Infallibility</hi> is aſſerted to belong to <hi>every one of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I need not Travel far to find Inſtances undeniable, upon this Head. But I will be as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in Expoſing them as I can. Therefore, without telling Names, the <hi>Friends</hi> do know that there is a <hi>Quaker Glover</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:32815:231"/>who had his <hi>Till</hi> Robb'd, and that a <hi>Quaker Prophet</hi> came to him, and told him he was ſent from God, to Reveal to him, <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> that his <hi>Maid Servant</hi> (who was likewiſe a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>) was the Perſon who had Robb'd him. The Maid, being thus Charged, ſtood reſolutely in aſſerting of her Innocency. But the <hi>Prophet</hi> endeavour'd to bear her down by his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Authority; and bid her not deny it, for ſhe was ſeen do it. <hi>Who ſaw me?</hi> ſaid the Maid. The <hi>Prophet</hi> reply'd (with a Monſtrous aſſurance!) <hi>The Lord ſaw thee.</hi> This prevail'd ſo far with the <hi>Glover</hi> that he had his Maid before a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> who was perſuaded, the more to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie her, to ſend her to <hi>Newgate,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:32815:232"/>where ſhe was threatned with the Irons, or put in them: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cou'd extort any Confeſſion from her, and having no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt her, at length ſhe was diſmiſs'd from the Priſon; but her Maſter (the <hi>Glover</hi>) believing the <hi>Prophet,</hi> turn'd her out of Doors.</p>
               <p>Had that poor Maid been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Threatened</hi> or <hi>Flattered</hi> into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Confeſſion, here had been a <hi>Prophet</hi> as great as <hi>Elijah!</hi> But however the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſtuck to his point, and thoſe who were ſo inclin'd, believ'd him rather than the Maid.</p>
               <p>But (Alas!) this Story did not end here. For the Devil ow'd ſome Body a ſhame. And theſe <hi>Quaker Prophets</hi> reſolv'd to try
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32815:232"/>their hands round, ſince they had begun, and ſee if they could terrifie ſome or other to Confeſs to their <hi>Infallibility:</hi> and then all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhou'd have been Deafened with their Miraculous Gifts.</p>
               <p>In order to this, ſoon after the <hi>Glover</hi> had turn'd off his Maid, as above-ſaid, there came to him, <hi>in the Power and Spirit of the Lord,</hi> as he Blaſphemouſly pretended, one <hi>John</hi>—another <hi>Quaker Prophet,</hi> and told him, that as God ſent <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo had he even now <hi>Prophets</hi> among his People; that he was a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſent to him from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and did pronounce to him in the Name of <hi>the Lord God,</hi> that his Apprentice, then preſent, was the Perſon who had Robbed him.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32815:233"/>The young Man, the Apprentice tho' a <hi>Quaker,</hi> knew his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; and therefore did bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before his Maſter, confro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> this <hi>Prophet;</hi> and that with ſo much aſſurance and ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as overcame the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Confidence; who, thereupon, own'd to his Maſter and to him, that he was miſtaken in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for that it was not the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice who had Robb'd the <hi>Till.</hi> The <hi>Glover</hi> then asked the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> if he had ſpoke of this to any? The <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaid, <hi>Yea,</hi> to one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>Shooe-maker</hi> in <hi>Martins,</hi> near <hi>Alderſgate.</hi> Then ſaid the <hi>Glover,</hi> Thou canſt do no leſs than to clear my Apprentice to him, which he promis'd to do. And away went the Apprentice
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32815:233"/>with him, to ſee his Reputation vindicated, When they came there, and the <hi>Quaker Shoe-maker</hi> had gone with them into a Room, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> being loath to fall to his work, ſat ſilent, <hi>Humming</hi> and <hi>Groaning</hi> as if moved by the Spirit, till the Apprentice, having wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very long, minded him of the end of their coming there, and related to the <hi>Shooe-maker</hi> how the <hi>Prophet</hi> had confeſs'd himſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in charging the Robbery upon him, and had come there on purpoſe to own ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (the <hi>Shooe-maker</hi>) becauſe he had aſpers'd him to the <hi>Shooe-maker:</hi> And therefore deſired the Prophet to proceed, and perform his Promiſe. But the Prophet, having bethought himſelf, gave
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32815:234"/>no anſwer, but continu'd in his <hi>Humming</hi> poſture— The <hi>Shooe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> ſeeing the diſtreſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, interpos'd very ſeaſonably, and ſaid to the impatient Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>Perhaps, he deſireth ſome longer time to conſider of it.</hi> And turning to the <hi>Humming</hi> Prophet, ſaid, <hi>Doeſt thou not</hi> John? <hi>Yea,</hi> cry'd the Prophet, haſtily, finding himſelf reliev'd. And the Apprentice was forced to return to his Maſter, without the ſatisfaction which was promiſed. But, on the contrary, <hi>John</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, upon ſecond thoughts, found it beſt to ſtick to his <hi>Infallibility;</hi> and therefore return'd to the <hi>Glover,</hi> and repeated his Charge, <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> againſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice: But after this, the <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> was taken, Robbing a <hi>Till</hi> at

And nothing left to the <hi>Friends</hi> to ſalve up the Deceit of this Prophet, otherwiſe than by concealing it. But they ſee, it is not conceal'd; nor a great many more Inſtances, which, if they will join Iſſue upon that point, ſhall be produc'd.</p>
               <p>Only, for the preſent, let me mention one yet more Notorious, and Remarkable miſtake in a greater Prophet and Preacher of theirs call'd <hi>Solomon Eccles:</hi> And the Proof is not Hear-ſay, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, in a Letter of his, which he did not <hi>ſend</hi> but <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>deliver</hi> to a <hi>Fellow Quaker</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>Note, That as <hi>T. Criſp</hi> tells us, in his Book above-Quoted, this <hi>John Story</hi> was, at that time, <hi>ill, and not like to live long.</hi>

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:32815:240"/>
               <p>And that they cou'd diſcern who were <hi>True Quakers,</hi> and who were only <hi>Falſe</hi> or <hi>Pretended</hi> ones, <hi>without ſpeaking ever a word.</hi> For either <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> (who liv'd 25. years in their Communion, their <hi>Secretary,</hi> and a Principal Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) <hi>G.

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:32815:241"/>
               <p>But if <hi>Keith, Bugg,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>True Quakers;</hi> then <hi>True Quakers</hi> are not <hi>Infallible.</hi> And then <hi>G.F. &amp;c.</hi> (who ſaid they were <hi>Infallibile</hi>) were led by the Spirit of <hi>Deluſion,</hi> and not by the Spirit of <hi>Truth.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> or of each <hi>Particular Quaker</hi> is now Damn'd by their <hi>Church;</hi> and their <hi>Infallibility</hi> is <hi>now</hi> Reduc'd by them (as in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whence their firſt <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> came, as told before, and wherein it naturally ends) to that of their <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Proof of this,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their <hi>Meetings</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Penſylvania, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> have Cenſured <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and other <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists</hi>

               <p>This appears in the Account of the Proceedings <hi>There</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>G. Keith,</hi> &amp;c. in the Year 1692. which was Publiſhed by <hi>G.

And <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> was one of the <hi>Five Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> who Sign'd the Warrant.</p>
               <p>But the Pretence in the ſaid Warrant was for Reflecting upon Their Majeſties <hi>Juſtices of the Peace</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Appeal;</hi> for ſome of theſe 28 <hi>Miniſters</hi> who judg'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32815:244"/>
                  <hi>George Keith,</hi> were likewiſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace, as the aboveſaid <hi>Samuel Jennings,</hi> &amp;c. Yet how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely do they inveigh againſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in our <hi>Church</hi> being Juſtices of Peace!</p>
               <p>But this double Capacity of <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſerves them in ſtead in other matters, as in the Caſe of the <hi>Sloop</hi> above-mention'd. But I muſt not omit to acquaint the Reader that the ground of this Proſecution againſt <hi>G. Keith</hi> was his Preaching Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> or a <hi>Perſonal Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> beſides the <hi>Light within,</hi> which, he ſaid, was only the <hi>Spiritual preſence of Chriſt by his Light and Life, in all his Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>G. Keith</hi> was accus'd for Preaching <hi>Two</hi> Chriſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32815:244"/>Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> beſides the Chriſt <hi>within.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Denying the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Light within,</hi> which <hi>Light</hi> the other <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay <hi>is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without the Man Christ Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> (after their manner of mumbling Thiſtles) will not <hi>Confeſs,</hi> but dare not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they took no Offence at Preaching a <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> and thought this not derogatory to the ſufficiency of their <hi>Light within,</hi> Why was <hi>G. Keith</hi> accuſed for this, and nothing elſe? What need was there for the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> (as <hi>Thomas Fitzwater,</hi> and <hi>Will.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32815:245"/>gives the Account? Why was this the buſineſs of ſo many <hi>Meetings,</hi> and of ſo great ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and at laſt of an open <hi>Separation,</hi> if the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, in good earneſt, believe in a Chriſt <hi>without</hi> them, or in a <hi>Perſonal Chriſt</hi> who ſuffer'd, and dy'd for us, and now Reigns in <hi>Heaven</hi> in the ſame <hi>Body?</hi> For <hi>G. Keith</hi> is not ſo much as Accus'd for Preaching any thing elſe but this. And I think this as good as a Demonſtration, That (however they endeavour to mince the matter) they do not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> believe in any other <hi>Saviour</hi> than their own <hi>Light within;</hi> which they call <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo endeavour to amuſe us.</p>
               <p>But, Reader, take notice, that (as it is told in <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Apology

               <p>This will not only overthrow the <hi>Infallibility</hi> in each particular Perſon among them, but even

               </p>
               <p>This Judgment was ſubſcrib'd by 39 Men, and 43 Women: in all 82.</p>
               <p>And the Party that ſent the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-ſaid Judgment, writes thus: <hi>This Paper hath been Promoted in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Meetings ſince, and ſubſcrib'd: ſome few have Refuſed: in Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereof, other Perſuaſions have Poſted it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>'Tis true, Friends in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were turned to the Light in their own Conſciences, as their Proper Guide; but when it pleas'd the Lord to gather ſo great a Number into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Belief of the Truth, as were in few years gathered; then the Heavenly motion came upon <hi>George Fox</hi> as the Lord's <hi>Anointed,</hi> as being the <hi>Great Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and as one whom the Lord had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in the place amongſt the Children of Light, in this our Day, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was amongſt

               </p>
               <p>I was told by one preſent at the <hi>Quaker-Meeting</hi> at <hi>Radcliff</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 17th of <hi>February</hi> laſt, 1694/5. that Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> having Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and after <hi>George Keith</hi> riſing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32815:248"/>up, and Expounding ſome <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in another manner than Mr: <hi>Penn</hi> had done, that Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> ſtopt him, and ſolemnly Denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe words againſt him, <hi>In the Name of the Lord, I Pronounce him an Apostate, over his Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which occaſion, I have theſe few Queſtions to ask.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this was a Sentence from Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> himſelf, or from their <hi>Church?</hi> If the latter, it comes in the <hi>Claſs</hi> juſt before-mention'd, of their <hi>Church-Authority</hi> over the <hi>Light within</hi> particular Perſons.</p>
               <p>But if the former, then here is <hi>Private Light</hi> againſt <hi>Private Light.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> will pleaſe to tell us by what Authority he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd this Sentence againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Lord.</hi> If
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32815:249"/>by an <hi>Ordinary</hi> Commiſſion, of <hi>Succeſsion</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> by Regular <hi>Ordination:</hi> That I ſhould be glad to hear. But if by an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Commiſſion, ſuch as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, we wou'd deſire ſuch <hi>Credentials</hi> as they had, that is, <hi>Miracles.</hi> Otherwiſe, any Reaſon why this is not rank <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> and liable to the Sentence of thoſe who ſpoke <hi>In the Name of the Lord,</hi> when <hi>He</hi> had not ſent them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> owns the <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> but does not ſhew the <hi>Miracles:</hi> for he ſaid publickly in their laſt <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> 1695. in <hi>Excuſe,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification</hi> of his above-ſaid <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> That he was then ſo Tranſported with the extraordinary Power of God upon him, that he knew not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32815:249"/>whether he was <hi>ſitting, ſtanding,</hi> or <hi>kneeling,</hi> when he ſpoke the words.</p>
               <p>But whether this <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>Divine,</hi> or what other <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> will be beſt known from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it ſupported, and which was the ground of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. And it was thus told to me by one who was preſent, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> at a former Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had Explain'd this Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>That the Blood was the Life, and the Life was the Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Reſolves all into the <hi>Light within;</hi> which (as will be further ſhewn) they make to be the <hi>Archi-Type</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of what <hi>Chriſt's <hi>outward</hi> Body, Blood,</hi> and all that He <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> in it, were but the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadow;</hi> and ſo of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32815:250"/>much leſs <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> to our <hi>Salvation.</hi> But, to go on with our preſent matter of Fact,</p>
               <p>At the fore-mention'd <hi>Meeting</hi> the 17th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1694/5. <hi>G. Keith,</hi> taking occaſion to Diſcourſe upon the above-ſaid Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. did Expound it in a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner from what Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> had done (but without naming of Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>); Said, that it ought to be taken <hi>Literally;</hi> that it was the <hi>outward</hi> ſhedding of <hi>Chriſt's Blood,</hi> which <hi>cleanſeth from ſin;</hi> and that this was not to be Reſolv'd into the <hi>Light within,</hi> nor to be <hi>Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd</hi> away from the <hi>Letter:</hi> For that this was overthrowing of the <hi>Faith.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> roſe up, and Interrupted him, in the middle of his Diſcourſe (which I am told is contrary to the <hi>Method</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:32815:250"/>and <hi>Freedom</hi> of their <hi>Meetings,</hi> and <hi>Church-Diſcipline</hi>) and taking it to himſelf, and his former Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Text, which is told above, he inveigh'd, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Paſſion, againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> concluded with the Sentence of <hi>Excommunication</hi> above-told; and ſtopping <hi>G. Keith</hi> from any Reply, immediately Diſſolv'd the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>I will not here enlarge upon the Subject matter of this Diſpute betwixt them,; becauſe it will be fully Diſcuſs'd in the following <hi>Sections.</hi> Particularly <hi>Section</hi> 12, 17, and 18.</p>
               <p>But for the preſent, I only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the point of their <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> over the <hi>Light within par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons,</hi> which was their <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal</hi> and <hi>Great pretence.</hi>

Is there any <hi>Immorality</hi> or <hi>Iniquity</hi> in theſe <hi>Letters</hi> y, o, u, more than in T, h, o, u? And is not every Nation Maſter of its own Language?</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe were not the words of the <hi>Languages</hi> in which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were wrote. It is likely that <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and the reſt, in the Year, 1650. thought they were, and lighting upon ſome old
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32815:254"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh Bible,</hi> took it for the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> For, if ſtreſs muſt be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Letter,</hi> it muſt be ſurely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Original Letter</hi> in which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were wrote. And the <hi>Quakers</hi> may as well lay ſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſlation as upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in this Caſe. How do they in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Languages make the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> when <hi>you</hi> is us'd in the ſingular Number?</p>
               <p>Behold here, theſe Men whoſe <hi>Chief Principle</hi> it is to Decry and Damn the <hi>Letter,</hi> do ſet up, at the ſame time, the moſt <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous</hi> ſticking to the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> that ever was heard of ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo very <hi>Extravagant,</hi> that, if it had <hi>not been,</hi> no Man cou'd have believ'd that it <hi>cou'd have been!</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:32815:254"/>Or that any Men cou'd have made a Caſe of Conſcience of ſuch a ſenſeleſs and inſignificant Criticiſm?

                  <hi>I remember, before we were call'd</hi> Quakers, <hi>as I was ſitting in an Houſe in</hi> Nottingham-ſhire (<hi>about the Year</hi> 1648.) <hi>the <hi>word of the Lord</hi> came to me, and ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> And yet in his <hi>Great Myſt.</hi> p. 246, 247. he calls it <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to ſay that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>Word of God.</hi> His words are theſe, <hi>They</hi> (the Scriptures) <hi>are not the <hi>word of God,</hi> which thou</hi> (Chriſtopher Wade) <hi>hast <hi>Blaſphemouſly</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:32815:256"/>Spirit, did dictate to the <hi>Inſpired Pen-Men;</hi> But not a <hi>Living Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> partaking of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> like the <hi>Word</hi> Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Begotten!</hi> Cou'd this <hi>George,</hi> either of theſe <hi>Georges, Fox</hi> or <hi>VVhitehead,</hi> produce any one Man, even in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who ever aſſerted this of the <hi>Ink</hi> or <hi>Paper</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures?</hi>

               <p>Why then do they uſe this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction? Againſt whom do they uſe it? Againſt <hi>No Body;</hi> it was only to <hi>Shufle</hi> and <hi>Cut,</hi> to <hi>Cover</hi> and <hi>Excuſe</hi> their Contempt of the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and, in their place, Deifying of their own <hi>Spirit,</hi> and their own <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They knew that the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> cou'd not be diſcarded <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>above Board,</hi> nor all at once:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:32815:256"/>That the World had been long in Poſſeſſion of them, and of a juſt Veneration of them; and therefore wou'd not ſo eaſily part with them, nor accept of any <hi>Foxes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, inſtead of them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſet up a Power, like that of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Infallible <hi>Interpretation</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>Scripture:</hi> And improv'd it, as above is told, into <hi>Immediate Revelation</hi> equal to that of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> And, purſuant to this Plenitude of Power, they have taken upon them not only to <hi>Abrogate</hi> the moſt expreſs <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and Pronounce them expir'd, at their Pleaſure, as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> But to ſet up, and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute new ones, as the <hi>Womens Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (directly contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

               <p>And they having (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> which gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they cannot be bound by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or any <hi>Command</hi> in them, unleſs their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> does <hi>anew</hi> require the ſame thing which the <hi>Scripture</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Scripture</hi> remains of no <hi>Authority</hi> with them: becauſe, if what the <hi>Scripture</hi> Commands, be <hi>anew</hi> required by their <hi>Spirit,</hi> they are bound to obey it, becauſe required by <hi>their Spirit:</hi> But if the <hi>Scripture</hi> Command the thing, they are, (by their Principles) not bound to obey it, unleſs it be requir'd by <hi>their Spirit <hi>Anew.</hi>
                  </hi> Which is moſt effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving all into their <hi>Private Spirit,</hi>

               <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> does in the ſame place, find fault with thoſe

               </p>
               <p>This, with ſubmiſſion, inſtead of an <hi>Excuſe,</hi> is a full <hi>Confeſsion</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe otherwiſe, they may commit <hi>Theft, Sacrilege,</hi> and all <hi>Immoralities</hi> under this Umbrage: And no Command of <hi>Scripture</hi> can <hi>Reſtrain</hi> or <hi>Convince</hi> them, by this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32815:259"/>Latitude here granted; becauſe if they ſhou'd <hi>Enthuſiastically <hi>Believe,</hi>

                  </hi> that ſuch Command of <hi>Scripture</hi> was not required by <hi>their Spirit <hi>Anew,</hi>
                  </hi> it is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſuperſeded by this Principle.</p>
               <p>Thus it being Objected to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> that one of his <hi>Quakers</hi> had Pretended an <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Call</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to commit <hi>Theft</hi> or <hi>Robbery,</hi>

               <p>But as for things <hi>Inconſiſtent with Government,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes their <hi>Light</hi> can never dictate, I refer him to the firſt <hi>Section,</hi> and to <hi>ſome of the Quakers Principles,</hi> Sect. 10. to 18.</p>

               <p>It is true indeed, that the <hi>Church</hi> cannot ſubſiſt, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Society,</hi> without <hi>Government:</hi> But it is as true, that the <hi>Quaker</hi> Pretence to the <hi>Private Light</hi> in <hi>Particular Perſons,</hi> as a <hi>Principle</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling <hi>Scripture</hi> and all <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Ordinances, is <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> with <hi>Government</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or any ſecurity from all the <hi>Diſmal</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſtical <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Rapines,</hi>

               <p>And it cannot be deny'd.

               </p>
               <p>I here repeat the <hi>Caution,</hi> which I ſet down at the beginning of this Diſcourſe. That I do not include all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this: But thoſe only who, having ſeen theſe <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> and <hi>Deluſions</hi> of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and other their old <hi>Primitive Quakers,</hi> will not <hi>Renounce</hi> them; but ſeek to <hi>Cover</hi> and <hi>Excuſe</hi> them, and pretend ſtill to the ſame <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> that they had.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Light within</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> call <hi>that Light which lightneth every Man that cometh into the VVorld.</hi> They ſay that every Man has it. Yet they will not call it <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience. It is not Conſcience,</hi>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32815:266"/>Therefore the meaning muſt be, That none but, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this <hi>Light.</hi> Which they do ſuppoſe, but have yet given no proof of it, more than other <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts;</hi> that is, their own <hi>ſaying ſo,</hi> and being <hi>very ſure of it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>George</hi> Replies in theſe words, <hi>Did not Chriſt ſay that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32815:268"/>it was hard for him to kick againſt that that prickt him, and was not that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him that prickt him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is manifeſt Perverting of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> did not ſay <hi>that it was hard to kick againſt that that prickt him,</hi> or that any thing <hi>prickt him.</hi> The words which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke were theſe, <hi>It is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks,</hi> Acts 9.5. That is, againſt the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> which wou'd be too hard for him if he ſtrove againſt it; as a Man that kicks againſt <hi>Pricks</hi> or <hi>Goads</hi> of Iron, only hurts himſelf. But <hi>G. F.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Text to make it bear this ſenſe, that the <hi>Pricks</hi> here mention'd, were nothing elſe but the <hi>Pricks</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>Light within</hi> his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32815:268"/>
                  <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> love to ſpeak. But whether there was any thing of this in the Caſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> himſelf can beſt tell; who ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> And Chap. 22.3, 4. That he was not only <hi>fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,</hi> but <hi>Zealous</hi> in the <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians, exceeding mad against them,</hi> Chap. 26.11. Had he then any <hi>Pricks</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or of his <hi>Light within</hi> againſt the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of that wherein he was <hi>fully perſuaded,</hi> and <hi>Zealous?</hi> Or cou'd he <hi>think verily</hi> that he ought to do ſuch a thing, if he had had but any the leaſt <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>ſurmiſe</hi> againſt the Lawfulneſs of it? It will be very hard, when all this
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32815:269"/>is conſider'd, to make Senſe of the <hi>Quaker</hi> Notion of the <hi>Light within:</hi> Againſt which this Inſtance of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (among many others) ſtands as an irrefragable proof.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhou'd arrogate to themſelves ſuch lofty Titles, above all the reſt of <hi>Mankind,</hi> even to take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the very <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> upon the pretence of this <hi>Light within;</hi> and yet allow that every Man in the World has it, as well as themſelves. Indeed they make a Pretence from this <hi>Light within</hi> to excuſe their <hi>Blaſphemous pride,</hi> while they aſſume all the <hi>Worſhip</hi> due to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they call this <hi>Light,</hi> upon the account of <hi>His</hi> or <hi>Its</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation in them.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:32815:269"/>
               <p>And this was the very Ground and Foundation of all <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz. the ſuppos'd <hi>Preſence</hi> or <hi>Inhabitation</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> in their <hi>Images;</hi> or in the <hi>Sun</hi> and other <hi>Creatures</hi> whom they <hi>Worſhiped,</hi> upon that only Pretence; and as transferring the <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>God Reſiding in</hi> them, or <hi>Repreſented by</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And this very Excuſe do the <hi>Quakers</hi> give here,<note place="margin">Some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, <hi>Sect.</hi> 32.</note> 
                  <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> thus anſwering the Charge of <hi>Idalatry</hi> in their <hi>Adorations</hi> before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, paid to <hi>G. Fox.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By this Rule, <hi>Every Quaker</hi> may be <hi>Ador'd</hi> with Divine Honour, and all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> given to him, becauſe of his <hi>Light within,</hi> or the <hi>Life of Chriſt</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>Thirdy, I will ſhew in <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. That they allow of Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to that Man <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> upon no other account than as <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> allows it to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> that is, becauſe of the Reſiding of the <hi>Divine Word</hi> in Him. And they diſtinguiſh it from his <hi>Perſon,</hi> as <hi>Here</hi> from <hi>G. Fox's;</hi> for, as they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:32815:270"/>expreſs it, <hi>They can never call the Bodily Garment <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </hi> And they do own that the Name <hi>Christ</hi> does belong to every <hi>Quaker</hi> as well as to <hi>Jeſus;</hi> that is, to both, only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the <hi>Light within,</hi> which they call the <hi>Divine Word,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt.</hi> All which ſhall be prov'd in its place.</p>
               <p>Let me here only obſerve what an Uncouth and Prepoſterous piece of <hi>Humility</hi> it is to deny the Title or Civility of <hi>Maſter,</hi> or of their <hi>Hat,</hi> while, at the ſame time, they <hi>Worſhip</hi> one another with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour,</hi> and beſtow upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Titles</hi> far above what any <hi>Angels,</hi> ſince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, to be even <hi>Equal</hi> with God, of the ſame <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and the fame <hi>Soul</hi> with Him; and grudge
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:32815:271"/>not to apply all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Light within</hi> them, and to themſelves, for its ſake: Thus transferring the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Themſelves.</hi>

               <p n="2">2dly, No <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ever held that there was not a great Change of the Body, in its <hi>Qualities,</hi> at the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> It is ſown in <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> in <hi>Corruption;</hi> it is rais'd in <hi>In-Corruption,</hi> and in <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The ſame Anſwer will ſerve ver. 37. where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> does Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> by the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Grain</hi> that is <hi>ſown</hi> in the <hi>Ground.</hi> For the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſuch <hi>Grain</hi> is <hi>chang'd</hi> in its <hi>Qualities,</hi> but not in its <hi>Subſtance.</hi> The <hi>Grain</hi> muſt <hi>die,</hi> or elſe it will not <hi>Fructifie</hi> or <hi>Riſe again.</hi> In this <hi>Death</hi> it loſes ſomething, as the Husks; but it retains the <hi>Substance</hi> which riſes again, much alter'd from what it was when it was ſown; for it riſes in the <hi>Blade,</hi> then the <hi>Stalk, Ears,</hi> and then the full <hi>Grain</hi> in the <hi>Ear.</hi> But to ſhew that the <hi>Subſtance</hi> is not alter'd in all this, we find that every <hi>Grain</hi> riſes the ſame it was <hi>ſown,</hi> if you ſow <hi>Oats</hi> you expect not a Crop of <hi>Wheat.</hi> And there is full as much

               <p>And as to Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s mighty Wonder, how a thing can be <hi>chang'd</hi> and yet the <hi>ſame,</hi> which he cannot comprehend, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> it is ſo far from being any difficulty at all, that it proves the thing that is <hi>changed</hi> to be <hi>the ſame;</hi> becauſe otherwiſe, <hi>It</hi> were not <hi>changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>George</hi> be <hi>chang'd</hi> in <hi>Quality,</hi> in the State of his <hi>Health,</hi> or in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> this is a certain proof that

                  <hi>Chriſt <hi>is not diſtinct from the</hi> Father,</hi> ſays <hi>G. Fox. They</hi> (the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt) <hi>are not diſtinct</hi>— <hi>and you Prieſts are not fit to judge in ſuch things as they are; they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:32815:291"/>are too weighty and too heavy for you.</hi> This was becauſe theſe <hi>Priests</hi> (as he calls them) had ſaid, That the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> were <hi>Distinct;</hi> which <hi>Fox</hi> thus violently oppoſes.

               <p>But ſecondly, theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>G.

               <p>But they deny any proper <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, that he was <hi>made</hi> Fleſh; or that He and <hi>Jeſus</hi> were one Perſon.</p>

               <p>Yet they allow <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be call'd <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from the <hi>Dwelling</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in him: But, for the ſame Reaſon, they take the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſay that it belongs to <hi>Them,</hi> as well as to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> from the ſame <hi>Dwelling</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Them</hi> as was in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:32815:295"/>ſtrongly aſſerts the neceſſity of it, as it is an influence ſent from the Spirit of Chriſt into our Hearts, to guide and enlighten us, but not the very <hi>Chriſt</hi> it ſelf; and the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Impiouſly do Blaſpheme, denying any other at all.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>R. Gordon</hi>'s Reply, you will find the abominable broad Blaſphemous Hereſies which theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> did hold, as p. 20.

               <p>Who that had not his Head turn'd with ſuch <hi>Enthuſiaſtical</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, cou'd have imagin'd, that <hi>G.

               <p>And it is but conſequential to this, that all the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> ſhou'd be given to <hi>G. Fox</hi> as well as unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if there be no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> between them, then they are the ſame. And I have

               <p>But I turn from him, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, and invite the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go along with me, as a Concluſion to this whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and take a ſhort view of <hi>G.

                  <hi>SECT. XVIII.</hi> Some Remarks upon <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head's <hi>Creed,</hi>
                  </hi> Relating to ſome of the Particulars before-going</head>
               <p>IT has been a great and juſt Complaint againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they wou'd never give us any <hi>Creed</hi> or <hi>Summary</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi> They find fault with others; but tell not what they hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They dwell upon <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> but love not to ſpeak in the <hi>Affirmative</hi> what they wou'd be at.</p>
               <p>Well! Now <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has, <hi>at laſt,</hi> done it, in the <hi>Introduction</hi> to his <hi>Innocency Triumphant,</hi> which he Entitles thus, <hi>Our Christian Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony re-aſſum'd in the Affirmative.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:32815:302"/>
               <p>And ſo far he keeps pace with the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> that he compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it in juſt <hi>Twelve Articles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (alas!) when you come to conſider them, they do not go cleverly off from the above-ſaid Damnable Errors of the foregoing <hi>Quakers;</hi> but, on the contrary, he words his new <hi>Confeſsion of Faith</hi> in ſuch <hi>Dubious</hi> and <hi>General</hi> terms, as may indeed, at firſt ſight, deceive an unwary Reader; but yet keeps, off contradicting the Heart of the Hereſie, which he ſtill preſerves ſafe and untouch'd: And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but often with a ſlily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated Excuſe and Defence of it.</p>
               <p>Thus in his 1ſt <hi>Articl.</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt. Even the ſame Jeſus Chriſt who was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>at Bethlehem,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32815:302"/>This wou'd ſeem a plain Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Chriſt <hi>without;</hi> that it was meant of that Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not only of the <hi>Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then when you conſider that (as above-ſaid) they attribute the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to their own <hi>Light within,</hi> and to every one of <hi>Themſelves,</hi> as well as unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then it will appear that this <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s is a meer <hi>Fallacy;</hi> while it attributes no more to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> than to <hi>G. W.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us not wrong honeſt <hi>George!</hi> He confeſſes, <hi>Art.</hi> 10. in theſe words, <hi>Our Miniſters do not teach, that the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>belong to every</hi> Member <hi>in the</hi> Body (<hi>or</hi> Church) <hi>as <hi>Amply,</hi> as to Chriſt the Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that you may take notice of it, the word <hi>Amply</hi> is put
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32815:303"/>in a different Character, in old <hi>Black</hi> Letters, leſt you ſhou'd miſtake, and think that <hi>George</hi> was <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Amply</hi> as <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That was modeſt indeed! But then, <hi>George, Thou</hi> art <hi>Chriſt as well as Jeſus,</hi> tho' not ſo <hi>Amply:</hi> and then your <hi>firſt Art.</hi> above Quoted, which calls <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> means no great matter; but is rank <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry</hi> and <hi>Dodging,</hi> and caſting a Miſt before the Eyes of poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People: For I have that Charity for a great many of your Followers, as to think that they do not know thoſe <hi>Depths</hi> of <hi>Stan,</hi> and that <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity</hi> into which <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>others</hi> have led them: And out of which thou doſt not deſire to Reſcue them, but to bind them faſter in it, by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32815:303"/>this thy <hi>Equivocating</hi> and <hi>Jeſuitical Confeſsion of Faith.</hi> As <hi>Article</hi> 2. where you confeſs (with the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>) Chriſt's <hi>coming in the Fleſh.</hi> That is, as before explain'd, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Fleſh upon him as a <hi>Veil</hi> or <hi>Garment;</hi> but not, in the Language, and true Senſe of the Scripture, That he was <hi>made</hi> Fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. that is, took it into his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and joyn'd it in a <hi>Perſonal</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> ſo that (as it is expreſs'd in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed) <hi>as the Reaſonable Soul and Fleſh is one Man, ſo God and Man is one Christ.</hi> If you had believ'd what is contain'd in theſe words, you wou'd not have ſcrupl'd ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it down <hi>in theſe words;</hi> which muſt have given the beſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it had been your deſign to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32815:304"/>have given ſatisfaction without any reſerve for that wicked Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which you wou'd ſeem not to plead for, yet in ſuch words as you might eaſily afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to mean nothing againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Article</hi> 7. You ſay, <hi>We own no ſuch ſaying as that the Holy Doctrine or Divine Precepts of Scripture is either Duſt, Death, or the Serpent's Meat.</hi> But you ſay that wicked Men have Perverted the Scriptures. That no Body can deny to <hi>You.</hi> But what then? Is the <hi>Holy Word of God,</hi> therefore, become <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Serpent's Meat,</hi> becauſe you have made it <hi>Death</hi> unto your ſelves? <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.13. in anſwer to the ſame Argument which you bring; <hi>Wherefore the Law is Holy, and the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32815:304"/>Commandment Holy and Juſt and Good,</hi> tho' the <hi>Vnlearned <hi>and the</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>wreſt them to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi>
                  </hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
               <p>But what was it you call'd <hi>Duſt</hi> and <hi>Serpent's Meat?</hi> Was it nothing elſe but the <hi>Ink</hi> and the <hi>Paper?</hi> Did any Body ever ſay that <hi>Theſe</hi> were not <hi>Duſt?</hi> Or is <hi>that</hi> any part of the Conteſt betwixt us? Was it the <hi>Ink <hi>Only</hi>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Paper</hi> of which you doubt (as before Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Quakers Refuge</hi>) whether <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> was the Pen-Man? Thou meanedſt <hi>verily,</hi> which of them made the <hi>Pen;</hi> that was all upon the word of a <hi>Quaker!</hi> Was it the <hi>Pen</hi> or <hi>Ink</hi> of which you doubt, that ſome of it was not ſpoken <hi>by the Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi>
                  </hi> And whether
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:32815:305"/>ſome of it was not ſpoken by the <hi>Grand Impostor? Some by <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and yet <hi>True;</hi> ſome by <hi>True Prophets,</hi> and yet <hi>Falſe.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ink</hi> or <hi>Paper</hi> are neither <hi>True</hi> nor <hi>Falſe,</hi> but the <hi>Doctrine</hi> only which is written in them. And therefore, <hi>George,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thy mealy Modeſty, it is, It is indeed <hi>George,</hi> it is the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which you Blaſpheme as <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Serpent's Meat,</hi> on purpoſe to bring Men off from trying your Pernicious Hereſies by thoſe <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> and to make your Followers truſt wholly to your New <hi>Light within;</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which it is that you vilifie the <hi>written Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:32815:305"/>of God, which are moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to all your <hi>Groſs Deluſions;</hi> it is not the <hi>Ink</hi> nor the <hi>Paper</hi> that you quarrel at. No, they do you no hurt: But it is the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> according to which <hi>written Word,</hi> if any do not teach, the ſame Holy Scriptures do In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, <hi>it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> Iſai. 8.20. No <hi>Light! <hi>George!</hi>
                  </hi> Mark that. Your falſe Pretences to the <hi>Light within</hi> is here over-rul'd, and to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the <hi>written word, without.</hi> Theſe are <hi>hard ſayings</hi> to the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Friends!</hi> And it was for the ſake of theſe, and ſuch like Texts which Detect and Explode the miſerable <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of theſe Pretenders to <hi>Light,</hi> which made <hi>Thee,</hi> Friend <hi>George,</hi> in this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:32815:306"/>ſame Book, to which <hi>Thou</hi> haſt prefix'd <hi>Thy</hi> aboveſaid <hi>Affirmative <hi>Confeſsion of Faith,</hi>
                  </hi> p. 28. <hi>Excuſe</hi> and <hi>Justifie</hi> the <hi>Diabolical</hi> Suggeſtions in the <hi>Quakers Refuge</hi> againſt the Authority of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures,</hi> by ſaying that it <hi>Queſtion'd but of ſome</hi> (of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) <hi>not all,</hi> as I have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But now come, <hi>George,</hi> we are near an end, and we know not if ever we ſhall meet again; tell me, in the <hi>Plain, Downright, Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of thy <hi>Light within,</hi> Didſt <hi>Thou</hi> mean no more by this <hi>but</hi> that only <hi>ſome</hi> and not <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Ink,</hi> was <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>muddy,</hi> and fit for <hi>Serpents Meat;</hi> and that only ſome <hi>Sheets</hi> of the <hi>Paper,</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> or <hi>Barks of Trees</hi> on which they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:32815:306"/>wrote in ancient time, and might write the Scriptures, for ought <hi>thou</hi> knoweſt, was courſe and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Is all thy Malice only againſt thoſe baſe <hi>Printers</hi> or <hi>VVriters</hi> who Prophane the <hi>Letter</hi> by poor ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impreſſions, and provide not good <hi>Ink</hi> and <hi>Paper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>thou</hi> thinkeſt all this to be <hi>Railery</hi> not becoming <hi>thy</hi> Gravity: See, I pray thee, if it be any thing more than what <hi>thou</hi> ſetteſt forth as the very <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for thoſe vile Epithets which thou and thy Friends do beſtow upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And be aſham'd and bluſh (if thou canſt) for that <hi>Silly</hi> and <hi>Childiſh</hi> come off, with which thou <hi>Gravely</hi> undertakeſt to <hi>Banter</hi> all Mankind, as if all your <hi>Ignominies</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:32815:307"/>and <hi>Contempt</hi> caſt upon <hi>Scripture;</hi> were to be underſtood only of the <hi>Ink</hi> and <hi>Paper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is thy ſalvo more Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the <hi>Eleventh Article</hi> of thy aforeſaid <hi>Creed,</hi> wherein thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureſt to reconcile the <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Notions of thy <hi>Sect</hi> againſt the true <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> calling his <hi>Body</hi> a <hi>Figure, Veil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is really</hi> (ſay'ſt thou) <hi>contrary to our Faith and Principle to make Christ Jeſus himſelf <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Figure,</hi> a <hi>Veil,</hi> or</hi> Garment. Here the word <hi>only</hi> (as the word <hi>Amply</hi> in the <hi>tenth Article</hi>) is put in great <hi>Black</hi> Letters, to ſhew the ſtreſs thou layſt upon it. And to diſcover thy <hi>Sophiſtication,</hi> thou ſayſt, That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is not <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Figure,</hi> or a <hi>Garment.</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:32815:307"/>Not <hi>only!</hi> No more is a <hi>Cloak</hi> or a <hi>Veil.</hi> It is not <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Garment;</hi> for it is <hi>Cloath</hi> or <hi>Stuff,</hi> and may be put to many other uſes. There is no one thing in the World, that is <hi>only</hi> one thing. It may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under more conſiderations than one.</p>
               <p>But this (as I obſerv'd at firſt of thy <hi>Equivocating</hi> manner) is but a <hi>Negative</hi> Confeſſion. Thou telleſt us what <hi>Chriſt Jeſus <hi>is not.</hi>
                  </hi> Not <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Veil, Figure,</hi> &amp;c. ſo we may ſay that he is not <hi>only <hi>Man,</hi>
                  </hi> not <hi>only <hi>God;</hi>
                  </hi> that God is not <hi>only <hi>Juſt,</hi>
                  </hi> not <hi>only <hi>Merciful,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>George,</hi> this is not ſaying what he <hi>Is.</hi> He may be <hi>any thing,</hi> a <hi>thouſand things</hi> notwithſtanding of all thy <hi>not onlys.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:32815:308"/>
               <p>And thou uſhereſt in this <hi>Article</hi> with more Solemnity than any of the reſt (that we may not ſuſpect thee) with a <hi>Really. It is <hi>Really</hi> contrary,</hi> &amp;c. as above Quoted.</p>
               <p>But Really, <hi>George,</hi> this is not <hi>Re-aſſuming your Chriſtian Teſtimony, in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi>
                  </hi> as thou doſt promiſe in the Title to this thy <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We did not want to know what was <hi>contrary</hi> to your Tenets; this is ſtill hiding your ſelves in the dark, in <hi>Negatives:</hi> But we wou'd know <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> what it is you do Profeſs; and this thou didſt promiſe; and this thou haſt not perform'd.</p>
               <p>Therefore tell us plainly, did <hi>Christ</hi> aſſume <hi>Fleſh</hi> not <hi>only</hi> as a <hi>Veil</hi> or a <hi>Garment,</hi> (like <hi>Angels</hi> when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:32815:308"/>they appear'd in <hi>Bodies</hi>) but did he take <hi>our Fleſh</hi> into his own <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo as to make it one <hi>Perſon</hi> with himſelf, as <hi>our Fleſh</hi> is part of our <hi>Perſon,</hi> of our <hi>Substance</hi> and our <hi>Nature?</hi> Was it thus that Chriſt <hi>Cloathed</hi> himſelf in <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood?</hi> If, in this ſenſe, you wou'd mean that he took Fleſh, or was <hi>made</hi> Fleſh, we will not Quarrel with you for the word <hi>Garment</hi> or <hi>Veil;</hi> for ſo it may be ſaid that our <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>Cloathed</hi> with our <hi>Body,</hi> as with a <hi>Garment</hi> or <hi>Veil.</hi> It is not <hi>words,</hi> but the <hi>meaning</hi> that we contend about. And you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie the World, nor your own Conſciences with this Dodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about <hi>words,</hi> while you ſhun to declare what you mean by them.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:32815:309"/>
               <p>Nay, you do not ſhun to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what you mean by them. That is, on the <hi>Socinian Heretical</hi> ſide (as above is ſhewn) <hi>to wit,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not aſſume <hi>Fleſh</hi> into his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when you wou'd impoſe upon us, then you Dance about the words <hi>Veil</hi> and <hi>Garment,</hi> and will not deny the wicked <hi>Hereſies</hi> of thoſe before you; but rather inſinuate <hi>Excuſes</hi> and <hi>Defences</hi> for them, as I before obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>Thus, in this ſame <hi>Eleventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> we are now upon, after your full and <hi>Affirmative</hi> Declaration (as above-ſaid) you ſuborn two <hi>Texts</hi> as Favourers of your <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſie</hi> before-told.

               <p>Ah <hi>George! George!</hi> I cou'd forgive thee any thing but this. What! Put upon us at this rate! And with a fine Quaker <hi>Really</hi> too! But tell us, among Friends, didſt thou not <hi>Really</hi> know, <hi>George,</hi> the word <hi>veil <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  </hi> 10. and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>Phil.</hi>
                  </hi> 2. Meant nothing at all of what <hi>thy Friends</hi> mean by them in this Controverſie?</p>
               <p>Know then, <hi>George</hi> (if thy <hi>Light</hi> has hitherto forgot to tell thee) that the <hi>Veil</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is, the Partition-wall which encloſed the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> from the reſt of the <hi>Temple,</hi> was a <hi>Type of Chriſt:</hi> And that as that <hi>Veil</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:32815:310"/>was rent from the Top to the Bottom, at the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo open'd a way into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which was kept ſhut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none but the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> who was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> entering into <hi>It,</hi> and that but once a year, with the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Expiation,</hi> which <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> was the <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> And this ſhewed that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Heaven</hi> was only to be obtain'd by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our true <hi>High Priest;</hi> and that by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his <hi>own Blood</hi> (which by the way, was not <hi>his own Blood,</hi> if he did not aſſume it into his own <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Perſon;</hi> otherwiſe, he only carry'd it in, as the High Prieſt did the Blood of <hi>others,</hi> but not <hi>his own</hi> Blood) and as the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Veil</hi> opened the Paſſage
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:32815:310"/>into the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> Eph. 2.14. ſo the breaking of Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> on the <hi>Tree,</hi> broke down the <hi>Partition-wall</hi> which was betwixt us and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and open'd the Paſſage into Eternal Life; which otherwiſe had ever been kept ſhut againſt us.</p>
               <p>And this ſhews the neceſſity of Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> and of his <hi>Bodily</hi> Sufferings, <hi>without the Gates</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> (Heb. 13.12.) and the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> ſheding of his Blood, as an <hi>Atonement</hi> for our ſins; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Light within</hi> the <hi>Quakers;</hi> as the Father of all Lyes has Blaſphemouſly taught them. And as you have heard above Quoted from them.</p>
               <p>And which, thou <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and all the <hi>Now Quakers,</hi> if
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:32815:311"/>they had but one Dram of the Spirit of <hi>Christianity</hi> in them, wou'd Renounce and Deteſt, and with Zeal diſown the Authors of ſuch <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> and not <hi>Palliate</hi> and <hi>Excuſe</hi> them, as even thou, <hi>George,</hi> doſt, and ſeek'ſt to ſodder their Leaky <hi>Infallibility;</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> may'ſt Inherit it. But if thou haſt <hi>ſown the wind,</hi> thou wilt <hi>Reap the Whirl-wind.</hi> Hoſ. 8.7.</p>
               <p>And now I have told you in what Senſe Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> is call'd a <hi>Veil.</hi> Heb. 10. But what has this to do with the Senſe in which the <hi>Quakers</hi> above Quoted do call it a <hi>Veil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They call <hi>It</hi> a <hi>Veil;</hi> that is, a <hi>Garment,</hi> in contradiction to <hi>Its</hi> being Chriſt's <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and of his <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:32815:311"/>
               <p>But <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. It is call'd a <hi>Veil</hi> in Relation to its <hi>Type,</hi> the <hi>Veil</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are as quite different Conſiderations as can be, as far diſtant as Eaſt and Weſt: And yet <hi>George Whitehead</hi> brings in the one to ſupport the other; which is a groſs Sophiſtication, and, if not the height of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> it is a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> Deceit.</p>
               <p>As is his Application of that other Text <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. where <hi>George Whitehead</hi> brings in the word <hi>Figure,</hi> which is not in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: But let him have it. He himſelf makes it Synonymous to <hi>Shape: Who being found in the <hi>Shape</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of a Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now what Relation has this to the calling <hi>Christ Jeſus</hi> a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:32815:312"/>
                  <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of their <hi>Light within?</hi> Which I have ſhewn above out of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Type</hi> and a <hi>Shape,</hi> are things ſo diſtant as to have no Relation at all, or Likeneſs to one another. A <hi>Type</hi> is being the <hi>Fore-Runner,</hi> or <hi>Shadow,</hi> which points out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to come: But what has this to do with the <hi>ſhape</hi> of ones Body? And becauſe the word <hi>Figure</hi> may be apply'd either to a <hi>Type</hi> or a <hi>Shape;</hi> therefore <hi>George Whitehead</hi> brings it where he confeſſes that it means a <hi>Shape,</hi> to juſtifie the <hi>Quaker</hi> Blaſphemy of calling him a <hi>Type</hi> of their <hi>Light within;</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> will not ſay that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Shape</hi> of their <hi>Light</hi> within; and that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he puts upon the word <hi>Figure</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:32815:312"/>in this Text; and therefore he can make no advantage of it to his Cauſe; he brought it in only as an <hi>Amuſement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cou'd give ſeveral other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like Ingenuity and Craft in the <hi>Quaker Anſwers:</hi> But I intend not this for a thorough Examination of all their Errors; only to give the Reader a ſhort view of their Principal and moſt Monſtrous Hereſies; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them (if poſſible) to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of them.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, I hope what has been ſaid will be ſufficient to keep others from going into their Snares; till they have clearly and fully given ſatisfaction to what is here object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:32815:313"/>
               <p>And let them either juſtifie what is plainly Quoted out of their Books: or freely diſown and condemn the Blaſphemous Errors of <hi>G. Fox</hi> their firſt <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and others of their Party.</p>
               <p>But if they will not do this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for ſpoiling of their <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Then let them ſtick to their <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they will do neither, then we may truly judge them to be <hi>Self-condemn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in the next place, That they have more concern for their own Honour, than for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Truth of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> who will refuſe or ſcruple to condemn the moſt Monſtrous <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> but ſeek rather to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Palliate,</hi> and <hi>Excuſe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:32815:313"/>
               <p>If they think that I have wrong'd them in this Character, let their Vindication appear, in a <hi>Clear, Plain,</hi> and <hi>Categorical</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what is ſaid above. Let that be the <hi>Criterion</hi> to judge of their Sincerity. And ſo I leave them.</p>
               <p>And now I have one word to ſay to thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> of the <hi>Separate</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
               <p>Theſe have thrown off the Pretence of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Yet they will be <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtill.</p>
               <p>They own Chriſt <hi>without;</hi> and Redemption through his <hi>Blood.</hi> Thus far they are return'd to the <hi>Orthodox Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they ſtick ſtill to the <hi>Quaker</hi> Spirit in denying the <hi>Sacraments</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:32815:314"/>which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Ordained in his <hi>Church:</hi> and in the <hi>Schiſm</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> the firſt <hi>Infallible Quaker,</hi> made from the <hi>Church,</hi> and that upon the account of their own <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Now how can theſe, who have thrown off that Blaſphemous Pretence to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> remain ſtill in that <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is grounded only upon that <hi>Infallibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But farther, a <hi>Falſe</hi> Pretence to <hi>Infallibility</hi> is not only an <hi>Error,</hi> but it is a high <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> and can proceed from none but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Deluſion.</hi> And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes from that <hi>Spirit,</hi> is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Now it ſeems Incredibly ſtrange, that thoſe who have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the <hi>Fundamental Forgery,</hi> ſhou'd yet ſtick to that ſame <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:32815:314"/>in other things! And thoſe of no leſs conſequence than the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Body</hi> in pieces, and breaking the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> by <hi>Schiſm;</hi> and throwing off thoſe outward <hi>Ordinances</hi> which are of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Immediate Inſtitution, and Commanded to be continu'd <hi>till his Coming again;</hi> and Appointed by him as <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and therefore are the Grounds for our <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I thank God, I have found in ſeveral of them a good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards receiving again the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> They have learnt to ſpeak of them with Reverence; and wiſh they had never been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed; and are ſenſible that great hurt has thereby come to the <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:32815:315"/>eſpecially among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who for want of theſe <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigns,</hi> have loſt the <hi>Subſtance;</hi> and <hi>ſpirited</hi> away the <hi>Reality</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's <hi>Natural Body,</hi>
                  </hi> and his <hi>Body</hi> ſuffering for us, together with thoſe Holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> which he Inſtituted for the continual Commemoration thereof.</p>
               <p>But there is a time for all things: And theſe Beginnings will, I hope, grow into a Perfect Reconciliation of theſe miſled People to the <hi>True Chriſtianity;</hi> and the <hi>True Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from which they have ſo unhappily and cauſeleſly divided.</p>
               <p>It is this year, juſt <hi>Forty</hi> years ſince their firſt appearing in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. London</hi> is the <hi>Center</hi> of all of them through the World:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32815:315"/>Whither Deputies come every year from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and all other their Colonies through the World. Such <hi>Intelligence,</hi> and <hi>Politick Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> is no where elſe to be found, but among the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> And therefore I begin with them here in <hi>London,</hi> that if it pleaſe God, their <hi>Return</hi> may proceed by the ſame Steps, and in the ſame Rode by which their Deceivers have led them: And I pray God that they may now at laſt find Reſt, and arrive ſafely in <hi>Canaan,</hi> after their <hi>Forty</hi> years wandering through the <hi>Waſt</hi> and <hi>Howling</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, wherein were <hi>Fiery flying Serpents</hi> of Mortal <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi>
